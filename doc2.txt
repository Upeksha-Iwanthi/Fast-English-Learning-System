gave me a second-class degree,

It's called motor neuron disease.

It's a progressive neurological disorder

The signals that muscles must receive
in order to move are disrupted.

00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:15,850
The result is gradual muscle decay.

01:05:53,158 --> 01:05:55,886
The two great pillars of physics

897
01:05:56,244 --> 01:05:58,563
are quantum theory,

898
01:05:58,746 --> 01:06:02,976
the laws that govern the very
small particles, electrons and so on,

899
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:05,983
and general relativity.

900
01:06:06,212 --> 01:06:07,780
Ah, yes, Einstein.

901
01:06:08,173 --> 01:06:09,240
Einstein's theory, the laws that govern

902
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:11,117
the very large planets and such.

903
01:06:11,217 --> 01:06:14,287
But quantum and relativity...

904
01:06:14,387 --> 01:06:16,489
Don't tell me. They're different?

905
01:06:16,931 --> 01:06:19,659
They don't remotely
play by the same rules.

906
01:06:20,393 --> 01:06:24,089
If the world were
all potatoes, then, easy.

907
01:06:24,189 --> 01:06:26,883
You could trace a precise beginning

908
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:28,835
as Stephen once did.

909
01:06:29,235 --> 01:06:31,178
A moment of creation.

910
01:06:31,946 --> 01:06:34,640
Hallelujah. God lives.

911
01:06:35,283 --> 01:06:36,768
If you incorporate peas into the menu,

912
01:06:36,868 --> 01:06:38,515
well, then it all goes a little...

913
01:06:38,786 --> 01:06:40,939
- Tits up.
- Oh. (CHUCKLING)

914
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:43,108
Yes. Haywire.

915
01:06:43,208 --> 01:06:45,527
- It just all becomes a godless mess.
- Oh, dear.

916
01:06:46,211 --> 01:06:48,188
- (CHUCKLING)
- Einstein hated peas.

917
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:53,611
Quantum theory. He said,
"God doesn't play dice with the universe."

918
01:06:54,135 --> 01:06:57,535
STEPHEN: Seems he not only plays dice,

919
01:06:58,264 --> 01:07:03,040
but he throws them
where we can't find them.

920
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:06,756
- God is back on the endangered species list.
- (JONATHAN CHUCKLING)

921
01:07:07,232 --> 01:07:10,009
Well, I expect he'll cope.

922
01:07:10,109 --> 01:07:13,805
And physics is back in business.

923
01:07:13,905 --> 01:07:15,177
JANE: Yes.

924
01:07:16,783 --> 01:07:19,102
Physics is back in business.

925
01:07:30,255 --> 01:07:32,653
I was, uh, married, actually.

926
01:07:33,841 --> 01:07:36,660
Um... But, sadly, she passed.

927
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:40,498
Almost a year ago now.

928
01:07:40,598 --> 01:07:42,041
(EXHALING)

929
01:07:43,142 --> 01:07:44,915
It was, uh, leukemia.

930
01:07:47,313 --> 01:07:50,166
Um, she fought it and I nursed her.

931
01:07:51,484 --> 01:07:53,428
But, uh, in the end...

932
01:07:53,528 --> 01:07:55,255
Um... (SIGHING)

933
01:07:58,783 --> 01:08:00,727
I do get quite lonely.

934
01:08:00,827 --> 01:08:04,181
The, uh, (INHALING DEEPLY)
tyranny of the empty room

935
01:08:05,164 --> 01:08:06,607
and all that.

936
01:08:07,959 --> 01:08:11,529
But music is my salvation.
Teaching and playing.

937
01:08:11,629 --> 01:08:14,616
Not really as a career,
but I'm not very ambitious.

938
01:08:14,716 --> 01:08:16,534
Though that's not...

939
01:08:17,302 --> 01:08:19,154
(SIGHING)

940
01:08:22,515 --> 01:08:24,913
Is that a sin? I don't know.

941
01:08:26,728 --> 01:08:29,331
Wrong man to ask.

942
01:08:35,194 --> 01:08:36,971
Thank you so much for having me.

943
01:08:37,071 --> 01:08:39,924
- Thank you for coming.
- It was really, really wonderful.

944
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:43,269
If there's anything
I can do to be of service,

945
01:08:43,369 --> 01:08:44,395
um, to you,

946
01:08:44,495 --> 01:08:46,814
to the family, I mean, I would

947
01:08:46,914 --> 01:08:48,732
consider it a privilege.

948
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:52,400
I have no children or commitments, so...

949
01:08:53,296 --> 01:08:56,650
I only mean that if I could be of help,

950
01:08:57,091 --> 01:08:59,035
I believe I might find
a purpose that would

951
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:01,909
help alleviate my own,
um, situation. (CHUCKLES)

952
01:09:04,057 --> 01:09:05,158
Good night.

953
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:07,414
Night.

954
01:09:43,304 --> 01:09:45,748
I understand

955
01:09:48,101 --> 01:09:50,454
if you need help.

956
01:09:53,898 --> 01:09:59,220
If someone is prepared to offer it,

957
01:10:03,241 --> 01:10:05,639
I won't object.

958

01:10:50,037 --> 01:10:51,810
(CHUCKLING) Yeah, it's very bracing.

961
01:11:23,863 --> 01:11:25,348
(CHUCKLES) Come on. Ready?

962
01:11:25,448 --> 01:11:27,175
- Yeah.
- (GRUNTING) All right.

963
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:32,104
17, 18...

964
01:11:39,837 --> 01:11:42,565
There we go. Right.
I'm going to put the kettle on.

Great, lovely, okay. We can go.

01:12:47,655 --> 01:12:49,348
Just gone 7:45.

971
01:12:49,657 --> 01:12:53,102
- (CHUCKLES) Could you all leave your copies?
- Goodbye.

972
01:12:59,584 --> 01:13:01,106
There's something I need to tell you.

973
01:13:02,336 --> 01:13:03,562
What?

974
01:13:04,338 --> 01:13:05,815
I'm pregnant.

Gosh, I, um, assumed
that you and Stephen, um...

977
01:13:13,139 --> 01:13:15,412
Well, that's really wonderful.

978
01:13:16,183 --> 01:13:18,581
- It is.
- Yes, wonderful.

979
01:13:19,478 --> 01:13:21,580
(CHUCKLES) Congratulations, Jane.

980
01:13:22,565 --> 01:13:23,882
Thank you.

981
01:13:39,290 --> 01:13:40,566
Everyone say, "Cheese." Ready?

982
01:13:40,666 --> 01:13:42,735
On the count of three. One, two, three.

983
01:13:42,835 --> 01:13:44,608
ALL: Cheese!

984
01:13:46,255 --> 01:13:47,447
Cheese.

- LUCY: Mummy!
- Just coming.

Oh, come on, sweetie. Come on...

Now, you know (CLEARING THROAT)

989
01:14:11,447 --> 01:14:15,768
I've always been supportive
of your choice not to have home help,

990
01:14:15,868 --> 01:14:19,017
but we need to find
a permanent solution.

991
01:14:19,497 --> 01:14:21,774
This, uh, situation cannot continue.

992
01:14:21,874 --> 01:14:27,026
You need to have a proper
live-in nurse immediately.

993
01:14:27,463 --> 01:14:29,190
We have help.

994
01:14:29,882 --> 01:14:33,327
Look, you know what I'm talking about.

995
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:36,823
We can't afford a live-in nurse.

996
01:14:37,139 --> 01:14:38,661
Stephen, you need to find a way

997
01:14:39,225 --> 01:14:40,827
for your family's sake.

998
01:14:41,143 --> 01:14:42,836
You're world-famous.

For black holes, not for rock concerts.

1000
01:14:47,733 --> 01:14:49,835
Stephen, this isn't funny.

1001
01:14:50,569 --> 01:14:52,467
I believe it's urgent.

We have a right to know, Jane.

1005
01:15:21,392 --> 01:15:22,835
Know what?

1006

ISOBEL: Whose child Timothy is.

1007
01:15:26,313 --> 01:15:28,791
Stephen's or Jonathan's.

1008
01:15:31,444 --> 01:15:33,512
That's what you think of me.

1009
01:15:35,281 --> 01:15:38,809
There's no way that Timothy could
have any other father than Stephen.

1010
01:15:38,909 --> 01:15:40,135
None.

So, what does it matter?

1016
01:15:57,470 --> 01:15:59,205
It's difficult for me because
I'm just trying to help.

1017

I know you're trying to help,
and your help is valued.

I think maybe if... (STAMMERING)

Please, Jonathan. We need you.

by attacking it's most vulnerable members.

they are incapable of conforming to it.

behind the attack on abnegation

00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:08,396
Divergents will destroy our society,
unless we destroy them.

77
00:10:12,385 --> 00:10:14,837
And now we can.

78
00:10:15,719 --> 00:10:19,139
However, only a divergent can open this box.

79
00:10:24,384 --> 00:10:25,845
Find them!

80
00:10:26,782 --> 00:10:28,608
Every last one of them.

81
00:10:47,235 --> 00:10:49,439
Go with happiness.

82
00:10:49,826 --> 00:10:51,620
Go with happiness

83
00:10:52,192 --> 00:10:54,532
-You with happiness.
-Thank you.

84
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:00,427
Go with happiness.

85
00:11:02,105 --> 00:11:05,176
I really don't know how much longer I
can do this whole peace and love thing.

86
00:11:05,647 --> 00:11:07,726
It's the amity way, just try to blend in.

87
00:11:08,305 --> 00:11:11,666
I'm trying to blend in, and its just not working.

88
00:11:12,011 --> 00:11:14,388
-Coming through, on you right.
Hey here we go.

89
00:11:14,389 --> 00:11:16,813
Look a rainbow. It's pretty.

90
00:11:18,076 --> 00:11:21,420
Pathological offendiness along without
questioning passivity. I love this place.

91
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,884
Thank you. Go with happiness.

92
00:11:24,084 --> 00:11:27,550
Oops, Excuse me.
-Hey tris, I really like your hair by the way.

93
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,510
Did you try to cut it all short and weird...

94
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:32,212
Hey Peter, why don't you take your food and sit down huh?

95
00:11:32,412 --> 00:11:33,573
Or what?

96
00:11:35,481 --> 00:11:38,675
Besides I think we all should stick together
now that we are officially fugitives.

97
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:43,620
- Wait what do you mean by official fugitives?
-You don't know? You did'nt tell Caleb?

98
00:11:43,914 --> 00:11:46,824
Yesterday Jeanine announced that the attack on Abnegation

99
00:11:47,024 --> 00:11:50,801
was organized by a group of regenade divergents
And their sympathizers.

100
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:53,127
- So they're blaming this whole thing on us?
-Yeah.

101
00:11:53,619 --> 00:11:57,207
And Jeanine needed a reason to petition to
the council so they could institute martial law.

102
00:11:57,407 --> 00:11:59,222
And now she had one.

103
00:12:08,388 --> 00:12:10,940
Staying here at Amity is the best option for now.

104
00:12:11,715 --> 00:12:14,697
We need to keep an eye of the ground and
find out where the rest of the dauntless are.

105
00:12:15,489 --> 00:12:19,221
-Then we can make a move.
-We need to kill Jeanine.

106
00:12:21,327 --> 00:12:23,801
I know, we're not ready yet.

107
00:12:28,964 --> 00:12:32,413
- Beatrice you're not being serious, right?
-No I am being serious..

108
00:12:33,412 --> 00:12:35,712
I'm not gonna stop until she's dead.

109
00:12:36,412 --> 00:12:39,997
- Tris you can't just go around killing people.
-She's right, listen to your sister.

110
00:12:40,197 --> 00:12:43,794
Tris, I think you should go to erudite and kill Jeanine yourself.

111
00:12:44,235 --> 00:12:46,566
I will stay with Caleb so they don't kill him too.

112
00:12:50,234 --> 00:12:51,361
What?

113
00:12:52,531 --> 00:12:53,955
C'mon you know.

114
00:12:55,148 --> 00:12:56,754
What you did with your parents.

115
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:14,881
Stop!!!

116
00:13:15,081 --> 00:13:17,221
What do you think you're doing?

117
00:13:20,077 --> 00:13:22,557
-My office! Now!

118
00:13:24,511 --> 00:13:27,487
Enjoy your meal everyone, enjoy your meal.

119
00:13:27,687 --> 00:13:29,903
Hey, you need to calm down.

120
00:13:36,231 --> 00:13:41,088
Was I not clear that the terms of your sanctuary here
included non violence?

121
00:13:41,633 --> 00:13:44,577
Well I can guarantee you nothing like this will ever happen again.

122
00:13:45,931 --> 00:13:49,617
Be that as it may, you can no longer stay here with us.

123
00:13:49,817 --> 00:13:52,741
Your presence, it is just too disruptive.

124
00:13:55,329 --> 00:13:59,339
The truth is that our sanctuary was never
gonna last very long here anyways.

125
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:02,602
Was it?
With you not standing up to Jeanine.

126
00:14:04,533 --> 00:14:07,457
-You don't understand us at all.
-No I do understand you.

127
00:14:07,657 --> 00:14:10,381
I understand that you think you can stay out of this but you can't.

128
00:14:10,581 --> 00:14:14,937
One day she's gonna show up and Jeanine is gonna
take whatever power you think you have away from you.

129
00:14:15,137 --> 00:14:16,137
Tris!Tris!

130
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:22,686
Look, Johanna, we need a little more time.

131
00:14:23,536 --> 00:14:26,572
We need to find out where the rest of the Dauntless are, then we can leave.

132
00:14:26,772 --> 00:14:29,228
And then what? Attack Erudite?

133
00:14:29,428 --> 00:14:32,988
-I will not be a part of your violence.
-No one is asking you to.

134
00:14:33,188 --> 00:14:36,073
We just need a few more days.

135
00:14:40,061 --> 00:14:41,748
One.

136
00:14:43,262 --> 00:14:48,087
-One, what?
-One more chance.

137
00:14:51,026 --> 00:14:56,628
See, to be Amity is to forgive; others, and yourself.

138
00:14:57,534 --> 00:14:59,749
You're hurting Tris.

139
00:15:02,709 --> 00:15:05,686
And my heart goes out to you.

140
00:15:07,229 --> 00:15:13,035
I know what it's like to stand helpless
while you loose the ones you love.

141
00:15:15,225 --> 00:15:18,140
But killing Jeanine will not gonna bring your mother back.

142
00:15:19,158 --> 00:15:23,330
I know you're angry, but you're letting it consume you.

143
00:15:26,241 --> 00:15:28,203
-What is it?

144
00:15:46,196 --> 00:15:48,467
Stay here and keep quite.

145
00:16:08,615 --> 00:16:12,494
Gentlemen, Amity welcomes you.

146
00:16:12,843 --> 00:16:16,157
-To what do we owe the pleasure.
-This isn't really a social call Johanna.

147
00:16:16,357 --> 00:16:19,480
-We're looking for divergents.
-I see.

148
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,815
- Well of course, anything we can do to help.
-We need you to volunteer your faction to be tested.

149
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:28,056
This is screening technology from Erudite.

150
00:16:28,057 --> 00:16:29,364
Amity.

151
00:16:29,365 --> 00:16:32,255
Not that Jeanine is heading up yo the council
the whole improval processing got a little easier.

152
00:16:32,455 --> 00:16:35,591
-You're exceeding your jurisdiction.
-Now, Johanna.

153
00:16:35,804 --> 00:16:38,680
What happened to that Amity politeness.

154
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:44,756
The easy way, or the hard way?
It's up to you.

155
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:52,684
Alright, but under protest.

156
00:16:53,872 --> 00:16:56,663
Okay we're good to go!
Move it out!

157
00:16:58,755 --> 00:17:03,259
All Amity report to the dome all come to
the dome for new mandatory testing.

158
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:13,441
Ok, lets go, get inside!

159
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,005
You know something lady?

160
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:32,930
You seem awfully stuck in that doorway.

161
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:48,710
Eric is here. We need to move now, come on.

162
00:17:56,832 --> 00:18:00,380
-What's up there?
-Just my office.

163
00:18:23,116 --> 00:18:24,460
There's two guards with guns.

164
00:18:26,025 --> 00:18:27,684
We're going out the window?

165
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:30,670
We need to split up.

166
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:34,936
Okey, yeah.

167
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,257
Every man for hmself.

168
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:38,850
Good.

169
00:18:40,365 --> 00:18:42,663
Hey, they're up here!

170
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:46,224
Hey, they're up here! Come qon they're getting away!

171
00:18:48,444 --> 00:18:49,855
You're ready?

172
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:04,646
-Where?
-Out the window!

173
00:19:07,215 --> 00:19:09,023
I got three on foot heading towards the dome!

174
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:13,956
-Get them low!
-Repeat, three on foot toward the dome.

175
00:19:13,957 --> 00:19:15,426
Over there!

176
00:19:15,626 --> 00:19:17,647
-I demand amnisty!
-Sit down! Sit down!

177
00:19:17,847 --> 00:19:19,869
I believe in Abignation, it's my right!

178
00:19:28,119 --> 00:19:31,222
-Detain him!
-Let's go!

179
00:19:39,241 --> 00:19:40,943
Come on, keep moving!

180
00:19:52,075 --> 00:19:53,188
Run!

181
00:19:53,849 --> 00:19:55,001
Run!

182
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:04,701
Come on!

183
00:20:39,308 --> 00:20:41,483
-Listen!
-What?

184
00:20:41,683 --> 00:20:42,947
A train!

185
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:46,006
Go, go, go!

186
00:20:51,581 --> 00:20:52,751
Caleb!

187
00:20:53,781 --> 00:20:54,782
Keep moving.

188
00:21:04,011 --> 00:21:05,255
Ammo!

189
00:21:19,895 --> 00:21:21,140
Come on, go.

190
00:21:41,629 --> 00:21:43,234
-Go, go!
-Caleb!

191
00:21:44,463 --> 00:21:45,545
Move!

192
00:22:21,689 --> 00:22:23,633
You sure know how to make an entrance!

193
00:22:28,782 --> 00:22:32,249
-Factionless.
- Amity.

194
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:34,915
Oh, you stare like dogs.

195
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,342
I have no idea what this one is.

196
00:22:38,542 --> 00:22:42,566
-Look, we just need to get to the city, thats all.
-Well to bad, the train is taken.

197
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,870
And you damaged our cargo.

198
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:53,145
These are Abnegation and you are factionless right?

199
00:22:53,345 --> 00:22:54,805
-Caleb!
-I used to be Abnegation.

200
00:22:55,005 --> 00:22:58,191
We used the same bolts to make cloth for you.

201
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,719
Are you saying that we steal from you?

202
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:05,372
No no, I'm no longer Abnegation,
so technically you're not stealing from me.

203
00:23:05,572 --> 00:23:08,394
No, you're not stealing at all.

204
00:23:08,594 --> 00:23:13,474
It's a questions of semantics I suppose
wether it's stealing or sharing.

205
00:23:13,674 --> 00:23:15,433
-But it's all really the same.
-That's enough!

206
00:23:15,633 --> 00:23:17,900
Everybody relax alright. You've made your point.

207
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:21,465
-We'll get off your train alright.
-Guy, would everybody just relax?

208
00:23:21,665 --> 00:23:23,293
Why don't we take a seat?

209
00:23:26,771 --> 00:23:28,916
-I was just trying to help!
-Don't.

210
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:30,448
Yeah, this is going to be fun.

211
00:23:30,648 --> 00:23:32,661
Everybody calm down alright?

212
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:53,570
Caleb.

213
00:25:00,778 --> 00:25:02,943
Get off! Get off!

214
00:25:30,206 --> 00:25:31,474
- You alright?
 - Yup.

215
00:25:31,674 --> 00:25:32,943
Are you okay?

216
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:47,027
-Tobias Eaton.
- Say it again.

217
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,623
Tobias Eaton.

218
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:53,560
What you know him?

219
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:55,600
I am him.

220
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:04,413
We have been looking for you.

221
00:26:06,136 --> 00:26:07,470
What are they talking about? <br />Four!

222
00:26:25,825 --> 00:26:26,907
Follow me.

223
00:26:32,503 --> 00:26:35,342
Tris! I'm sorry, I wanted to help.

224
00:26:46,072 --> 00:26:49,924
Four! four! why are they looking for you?

225
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:52,620
How do they know your your name?

226
00:27:05,314 --> 00:27:07,164
This is factionless.

227
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:10,634
This is insane.

228
00:27:47,276 --> 00:27:48,487
Tobias!

229
00:27:52,367 --> 00:27:53,845
Mother.

230
00:28:00,942 --> 00:28:02,487
I thought she was dead.

231
00:28:05,932 --> 00:28:07,092
Me too.

232
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:25,749
Somebody please tell me what's going on here.

233
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,085
Tobias's father was very abusive.

234
00:28:34,473 --> 00:28:38,185
I knew the only way I could ever truly escape him was...

235
00:28:38,385 --> 00:28:40,095
to disappear completely.

236
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:45,198
Abnegation helped me fake my death.

237
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:48,022
Anything to protect Marcus image.

238
00:28:48,222 --> 00:28:50,907
But you just left him there alone with Marcus.

239
00:28:51,858 --> 00:28:53,587
I was very young.

240
00:28:55,013 --> 00:28:57,283
I reached out to him about a year ago.

241
00:28:57,867 --> 00:29:00,382
I felt it was finally time to reconnect.

242
00:29:02,187 --> 00:29:05,543
-I'm still your mother.
-No, my mother is dead.

243
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:09,312
I went to her funeral when I was six.

244
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:13,626
And she wasn't trying to reconnect with me.

245
00:29:13,826 --> 00:29:16,463
She was trying to use me.
Like you are now.

246
00:29:16,663 --> 00:29:17,663
What?

247
00:29:18,963 --> 00:29:20,283
She wants an army.

248
00:29:20,981 --> 00:29:22,894
-An army?
-I want an alliance.

249
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:25,980
-No, what you want is revenge!
-This isn't about me.

250
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:30,467
It's about putting an end to a system
that says one group is more deserving than another.

251
00:29:30,667 --> 00:29:34,920
This city may be surrounded by a wall
but it doesn't have to be a prison.

252
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:37,168
I think that's a bit extreme.

253
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:40,670
I mean, the factions isn't meant to be perfect
but it's hardly a prison.

254
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:43,774
Let me guess, you're Erudite?

255
00:29:46,123 --> 00:29:47,301
I was Erudite.

256
00:29:52,347 --> 00:29:55,710
-Are you willing to kill Jeanine?
-Absolutely.

257
00:29:57,316 --> 00:29:59,486
When I was married to Marcus I knew her well.

258
00:29:59,686 --> 00:30:02,011
And believe me, there's nothing she isn't capable of.

259
00:30:02,211 --> 00:30:07,368
-But I think you already know that.
-Tris, we can't trust her.

260
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:11,071
-Maybe she knows....
-We're on the same side, Tris.

261
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:15,371
I'm factionless because I don't fit in any one faction.

262
00:30:15,571 --> 00:30:18,673
And you're Divergent because you belong to too many..

263
00:30:18,873 --> 00:30:21,426
But we are both a threat to Jeanine.

264
00:30:22,341 --> 00:30:25,174
My people are ready for war if that's what it takes.

265
00:30:25,374 --> 00:30:26,374
And then what?

266
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:30,990
-We depose those in power.
-And once you've done that?

267
00:30:32,321 --> 00:30:35,631
Once you killed Jeanine, who's in power then?

268
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:41,050
You see, that's the part she always conveniently leaves out.

269
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:46,557
Don't tell me this isn't about you, this is only about you.

270
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:52,322
I know where the remaining Dauntless are hiding.

271
00:30:52,522 --> 00:30:55,477
-Where?
-They took shelter in Candor.

272
00:30:55,677 --> 00:30:57,157
As far as I know they're still there.

273
00:30:58,657 --> 00:31:01,031
Think about it. If we were to combine forces,

274
00:31:01,231 --> 00:31:05,365
Dauntless and Factionless, we'd be unstoppable.

275
00:31:05,565 --> 00:31:06,769
That's not gonna happen.

276
00:31:06,969 --> 00:31:11,575
Thank you for your hospitality,
but we will be leaving in the morning.

277
00:31:11,775 --> 00:31:13,029
Four, maybe this is...

278
00:31:13,229 --> 00:31:15,390
Tobias, please reconsider.

279
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,475
Don't you call me that.

280
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:21,498
My name is Four.

281
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,071
You want to talk him in, or should I?

282
00:31:56,206 --> 00:31:57,878
The food looks lovely.

283
00:32:00,334 --> 00:32:01,623
Thank you.

284
00:32:15,107 --> 00:32:16,252
I'm sorry.

285
00:32:23,746 --> 00:32:25,820
I should've told you about her.

286
00:32:36,476 --> 00:32:38,483
No more secrets.

287
00:32:39,662 --> 00:32:41,067
Okay?

288
00:32:51,741 --> 00:32:54,835
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.

289
00:32:59,341 --> 00:33:01,864
I always loved to watch him sleep.

290
00:33:05,705 --> 00:33:08,411
I take it you're setting out to Candor in the morning?

291
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:09,611
Yeah.

292
00:33:14,931 --> 00:33:18,751
Listen, I only want what's best for him.

293
00:33:20,698 --> 00:33:22,519
You hardly even know him.

294
00:33:24,665 --> 00:33:30,400
You'd like to think that wouldn't you?
But deep inside I think you're scared I know him all to well.

295
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:35,465
-Im not scared.
-Of course you are.

296
00:33:35,665 --> 00:33:39,742
You're scared that he'll finally
see you for what you really are.

297
00:33:42,143 --> 00:33:44,017
Deadly.

298
00:33:46,917 --> 00:33:48,637
You don't believe me?

299
00:33:52,516 --> 00:33:54,209
Ask him.

300
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,355
Are you okey?

301
00:34:02,555 --> 00:34:03,555
Yeah.

302
00:34:05,968 --> 00:34:08,561
-Sure?
-Yeah.

303
00:34:58,171 --> 00:35:01,251
-Im not going with you guys.
-What?

304
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:06,428
To Candor. I'm not going with you guys.

305
00:35:10,158 --> 00:35:12,712
-What are you talking about?
-What's your plan?

306
00:35:14,385 --> 00:35:16,338
You guys are gonna find the rest of the Dauntless
and then what?

307
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:17,967
You attack Erudite?

308
00:35:18,167 --> 00:35:20,809
Assasinate Jeanine and start a civil war?

309
00:35:21,784 --> 00:35:24,435
Im sorry, I'm just not cut out for that.

310
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,951
I'm not like you guys.

311
00:35:32,092 --> 00:35:37,428
I need to get back to Abnegation maybe...
....Maybe I can be usefull there.

312
00:35:37,674 --> 00:35:40,579
Caleb, there's nothing left in Abnegation.

313
00:35:42,856 --> 00:35:43,975
Yeah.

314
00:36:17,373 --> 00:36:20,183
-You okey?
-We just need to get to Candor.

315
00:36:23,713 --> 00:36:24,753
Triss!

316
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:33,107
I know you think Caleb is your responsibility
but he made his own choice.

317
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:36,016
You can't protect everyone.

318
00:36:37,716 --> 00:36:41,463
-I can't protect anyone.
-Nobody can.

319
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:46,590
Him leaving isn't your fault. None of this is your fault.

320
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,099
Johanna was right. You have to forgive yourself.

321
00:36:59,641 --> 00:37:00,682
Thank you.

322
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:03,685
We gotta move.

323
00:37:30,889 --> 00:37:32,995
-We found them!
-Yeah.

324
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:40,138
-Damn it's good to see you guys.
-How are you?

325
00:37:40,338 --> 00:37:42,237
I'm better now. I'm not exactly good for layong low.

326
00:37:42,437 --> 00:37:43,766
-Triss!
-Christina!

327
00:37:47,089 --> 00:37:49,312
-It's so good to see you.
-You too.

328
00:37:49,512 --> 00:37:51,545
Have you heard anything about Will?

329
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:56,693
-No.
-Nothing?

330
00:37:56,893 --> 00:37:57,893
No.

331
00:37:59,283 --> 00:38:00,981
Something must have happened to him.

332
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:03,779
He would've found me by now you know.

333
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:07,689
-Hey.
-Hey.

334
00:38:08,525 --> 00:38:09,755
How are you holding up?

335
00:38:11,223 --> 00:38:13,525
-How many Dauntless do we have?
-175 total.

336
00:38:13,725 --> 00:38:16,226
-175? That's it?
-The rest followed Max.

337
00:38:16,426 --> 00:38:18,927
-Not nearly the number we need.

338
00:38:19,127 --> 00:38:21,857
Hold it! Grab the guns!

339
00:38:24,087 --> 00:38:26,813
-Hey, they're with us.
-We know who you are.

340
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:29,740
Last warning. Drop your guns.

341
00:38:32,228 --> 00:38:33,637
Alright.

342
00:38:45,169 --> 00:38:46,586
Easy.

343
00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:02,348
- I'm Jack Kang, I'm leadership here.
-We know who you are.

344
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:04,232
We are not a threat to Candor.

345
00:39:04,332 --> 00:39:07,214
That might be your truth, it's not neccesarily mine.

346
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:12,106
All I know for certain is you are both wanted for
criminal insurgency and conspiring

347
00:39:12,306 --> 00:39:13,865
in the attack on Abnegation.

348
00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:18,645
Those are lies.

349
00:39:18,745 --> 00:39:21,719
If you were Candor I would take you at your word.

350
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:26,635
Unfortunately given the circumstances
I'm obliged to hand you over to the council.

351
00:39:26,835 --> 00:39:29,915
-You can make your case there.
-You might as well kill us now.

352
00:39:30,115 --> 00:39:33,287
If Jeanine finds us, we're not gonna live to stand trial.

353
00:39:33,487 --> 00:39:36,659
I doubt that very much.
She would never supersede the council.

354
00:39:36,859 --> 00:39:40,557
Are you sure about that?
Who's gonna stop her? You?

355
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,030
Factional law must be upheld.

356
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:46,142
No, wait wait wait.

357
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:48,360
Can I ask you one question?

358
00:39:49,826 --> 00:39:51,285
Can I ask you one question?

359
00:39:51,485 --> 00:39:56,040
Jeanine believes that Erudite are the most fit
to govern because they are the smartest.

360
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:59,544
You believe Candor is the most fittest
to judge because you are so honest?

361
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:02,168
I admit, I hold that belief.

362
00:40:02,368 --> 00:40:04,940
Then, would you say I trial held here at Candor

363
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:07,712
would be inherently more fair than a trial held by Erudite?

364
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:13,691
The answer is yes.

365
00:40:13,891 --> 00:40:18,467
In my opinion a Candor trial would have
the greatest chance of achieving true justice.

366
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:22,595
So you are asking me to petition a
council at the great Candor...?

367
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:26,440
No. As part of Candors initation
you administer a truth serum.

368
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:27,640
Correct.

369
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:32,362
We dont technically discuss such matters with other factions.

370
00:40:32,562 --> 00:40:35,225
-It's a pretty evasive answer.
-Evasion is not dishonest.

371
00:40:35,425 --> 00:40:36,830
But it's not exactly honest either.

372
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:42,242
-Yes, we possess such a serum.
-Then use it on us.

373
00:40:42,442 --> 00:40:43,542
Four!

374
00:40:43,642 --> 00:40:46,242
If we are guilty, we surrender to the council.

375
00:40:46,442 --> 00:40:49,233
If not, you just saved two lives.

376
00:40:49,433 --> 00:40:52,731
-And gain some loyal allies.
-Alright.

377
00:40:52,931 --> 00:40:55,261
But you should know the serum can be quite brutal.

378
00:40:55,461 --> 00:40:59,862
It was designed for tender applicants who
are already predisposed to honesty.

379
00:41:00,062 --> 00:41:03,055
Not everyone find it so easy to share their secrets.

380
00:41:04,715 --> 00:41:07,017
-I do not want to do it.
-We have to.

381
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,134
Neither of us have secrets worth dying for.

382
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,087
Let the truth set you free.

383
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:40,800
Tobias Eaton.

384
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:48,747
You are accused of conspiring with your fellow
Dauntless in the attack on Abnegation.

385
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:51,085
Is this true?

386
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,976
Conspiring no.

387
00:41:55,176 --> 00:41:56,992
But I did attack.

388
00:41:57,192 --> 00:42:02,133
I was in simulation controlled by Jeanine and
the rest of the Dauntless she had recruited.

389
00:42:03,274 --> 00:42:04,755
Tris found me.

390
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:11,382
She managed to break me free from the simulation
and together we fought are way out.

391
00:42:16,577 --> 00:42:19,598
So you are saying that Jeanine orchestrated this attack?

392
00:42:21,166 --> 00:42:22,516
Yes.

393
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:28,641
One last thing.

394
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:34,900
If you suspected that Jeanine had corrupted Dauntless,
why didn't you just leave?

395
00:42:36,356 --> 00:42:38,502
Why did you stay?

396
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:40,916
I wanted to leave.

397
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:44,270
But I fell in love with Tris Prior.

398
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:49,409
And I could not leave her.

399
00:42:58,030 --> 00:43:00,187
Thank you for your Candor.

400
00:43:00,387 --> 00:43:02,344
Thank you for your Candor.

401
00:43:02,544 --> 00:43:07,826
Tobias Eaton, this trial has concluded
and you are resolved of the guilt on the attack on Abnegation.

402
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,973
Miss Prior if you would.

403
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,058
Let the truth set you free.

404
00:43:40,004 --> 00:43:41,269
Tris Prior

405
00:43:43,489 --> 00:43:45,913
Mr Eaton said you managed to free him from the sim.

406
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:49,897
Yes.

407
00:43:50,330 --> 00:43:52,659
So you were never under the simulation yourself.

408
00:43:53,981 --> 00:43:55,015
No.

409
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:57,679
How is that possible?

410
00:43:59,086 --> 00:44:01,267
Because im divergent.

411
00:44:07,723 --> 00:44:09,385
I see.

412
00:44:12,130 --> 00:44:16,560
So you never harmed any of your fellow
Dauntless or the Abnegation?

413
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:20,589
I did.

414
00:44:28,228 --> 00:44:29,365
Who?

415
00:44:32,328 --> 00:44:33,874
My mom.

416
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:41,893
I watched her die first and then my dad.

417
00:44:41,993 --> 00:44:44,773
They were killed trying to save me.

418
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:56,639
Miss Prior, the more you resist,
the more painfull the serum will be.

419
00:45:04,266 --> 00:45:08,892
My friend ... I killed my friend.

420
00:45:09,610 --> 00:45:11,675
He was trying to shoot me.

421
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:20,551
And ... I shot him first.

422
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,578
What was his name?

423
00:45:33,004 --> 00:45:34,851
What was his name?

424
00:45:38,586 --> 00:45:43,072
Will. I killed Will.

425
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:55,708
This is what happens to
people that get close to me.

426
00:46:04,289 --> 00:46:05,830
They get hurt or they die.

427
00:46:08,529 --> 00:46:11,070
I can't forgive myself.

428
00:46:13,963 --> 00:46:16,037
Thank you for your Candor.

429
00:46:16,237 --> 00:46:18,311
Thank you for your Candor.

430
00:46:33,556 --> 00:46:36,668
Tris!

431
00:46:39,935 --> 00:46:41,872
Im sorry.

432
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:45,692
I told you I didnt want to do that.

433
00:46:58,164 --> 00:46:59,164
-Christina.
-Go.

434
00:47:02,522 --> 00:47:03,848
Go.

435
00:47:13,118 --> 00:47:15,448
Abnegation sim complete.

436
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:18,320
Dauntless sim initiated.

437
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:24,285
Mam, the Divergents viable is dropping.

438
00:47:24,485 --> 00:47:28,242
-If we dont pull her out of the sim soon we'll loose her.
-You stop when I say so.

439
00:47:34,993 --> 00:47:36,680
She's gonna do it.

440
00:47:40,885 --> 00:47:42,812
She's gonna pass the sim.

441
00:47:45,952 --> 00:47:48,635
Dauntless sim failed.

442
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,431
Divergent test subject six is no longer viable.

443
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:57,556
Alright shut it down.

444
00:47:59,890 --> 00:48:01,356
We are wasting our time.

445
00:48:03,430 --> 00:48:07,706
I've been asuming all the Divergents are the same.

446
00:48:10,691 --> 00:48:13,188
But some are stronger than others.

447
00:48:15,548 --> 00:48:19,182
Assign all non essential personnel  to Divergent detail.

448
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:21,383
We need to work harder.

449
00:48:21,850 --> 00:48:24,003
We need to find that very special one.

450
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:45,849
Where's your scary boyfriend?

451
00:48:49,583 --> 00:48:51,823
Probably out doing scary boyfriend things.

452
00:48:57,716 --> 00:48:59,402
Mind if I join you?

453
00:49:04,147 --> 00:49:05,593
I love heights.

454
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:09,850
Up here everyting seems much smaller, you know.

455
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:14,514
I know it sounds crazy, but...

456
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:18,750
Sometimes I think I see lights out beyond the wall.

457
00:49:20,910 --> 00:49:25,029
I know they say its all just wasteland out there but...

458
00:49:26,872 --> 00:49:30,075
We can't be the only ones left. Can we?

459
00:49:35,447 --> 00:49:36,603
C'mon!

460
00:49:36,803 --> 00:49:38,959
-Got any weapons ?
-No!

461
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,657
Coast clear, moving out!

462
00:51:26,915 --> 00:51:30,027
Mommy! Mommy!

463
00:51:32,396 --> 00:51:36,943
That thing hurt me?

464
00:51:37,835 --> 00:51:39,824
You see? It's ok.

465
00:51:40,610 --> 00:51:45,077
It's just  something to help you go to sleep.
I need you to do me a favour.

466
00:51:45,277 --> 00:51:49,744
You have to go to the top of the stairs and
don't come down until your mommy comes here.

467
00:51:49,944 --> 00:51:53,086
Don't come down. Can you do that?

468
00:51:54,542 --> 00:51:56,049
Be brave, ok ?

469
00:51:57,201 --> 00:51:59,513
Ok, go.

470
00:52:35,427 --> 00:52:36,607
Hey !

471
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:38,809
Why are we the only ones awake?

472
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:41,579
Because we're Divergents.

473
00:52:41,779 --> 00:52:44,397
Come on, I need your help to open this.

474
00:52:44,597 --> 00:52:46,476
I need your help.

475
00:52:52,075 --> 00:52:53,202
Hey!

476
00:52:53,762 --> 00:52:56,538
Look who decided to show up.

477
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,636
It's really good to see you again.

478
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:15,368
Alright folks, nothing to be nervous about.

479
00:53:16,050 --> 00:53:19,676
It's a little routine inspection,
then we all go back to our business.

480
00:53:22,195 --> 00:53:23,362
Hello.

481
00:53:28,041 --> 00:53:30,494
Divergent 10 %.

482
00:53:31,908 --> 00:53:33,303
Shit.

483
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:35,652
You're almost normal.

484
00:53:36,650 --> 00:53:37,661
That's boring.

485
00:53:40,228 --> 00:53:41,878
That is not part of the mission.

486
00:53:42,078 --> 00:53:43,228
So what?

487
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:46,674
As far as I'm concerned the rest of them are still outlaws.

488
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:51,668
Let's just wrap this up quick.
The others is gonna be awake soon.

489
00:54:04,053 --> 00:54:05,935
-Hi, sweetie.
-I should not...

490
00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:12,547
-Divergent 40%.
-I'm afraid it's not you either.

491
00:54:14,452 --> 00:54:15,947
The lady said that I should not...

492
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:20,020
The lady said that I shouldn't have come downstairs.

493
00:54:20,510 --> 00:54:22,465
Maybe you should have listened.

494
00:54:33,625 --> 00:54:36,410
Enough! You still have to test her.

495
00:54:38,976 --> 00:54:40,840
Jeanine stold us we have to test everyone.

496
00:54:48,408 --> 00:54:52,150
-Divergent 100%.
-I'll be damned.

497
00:54:52,451 --> 00:54:55,084
-What?
-She's what we've been looking for.

498
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:57,656
Bullshit.

499
00:55:01,620 --> 00:55:04,056
Divergent 100%.

500
00:55:06,530 --> 00:55:07,720
Get her in the veichle.

501
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:09,669
I'll alert Jeanine.

502
00:55:13,985 --> 00:55:17,126
If you think you got lucky, you are wrong.

503
00:55:18,136 --> 00:55:20,581
You gonna wish I killed you.

504
00:55:35,688 --> 00:55:37,470
Drop your weapons!

505
00:55:52,279 --> 00:55:53,479
Thank you.

506
00:55:55,330 --> 00:55:56,970
It's lucky you got that gun Four.

507
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:02,334
We both know your'e not much without one.

508
00:56:33,551 --> 00:56:37,505
You think you're safe now?
You're wrong.

509
00:56:38,590 --> 00:56:40,648
Jeanine will never gonna stop searching for you.

510
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:49,804
Why? What she want with her? Tell me!

511
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:54,771
It's exactly what Jeanine needs. It's the perfect subject.

512
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:00,468
Is that supposed to scare me?

513
00:57:02,188 --> 00:57:06,760
You're responsible for the death of hundreds of people.
You know the punishment for that.

514
00:57:07,526 --> 00:57:12,192
Listen...I found a way to live with the blood on my hands.

515
00:57:13,724 --> 00:57:14,950
But can you?

516
00:57:46,290 --> 00:57:47,900
Why dont they come out?

517
00:57:48,173 --> 00:57:51,113
All I know is that they put me sleeping
and then all hell break lose.

518
00:57:51,114 --> 00:57:52,313
Heck, don't play!

519
00:58:03,598 --> 00:58:04,974
You know what this means.

520
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:07,600
Thank you.

521
00:58:08,170 --> 00:58:11,330
-For helping us.
-I wish I could do more.

522
00:58:12,350 --> 00:58:14,770
I had no idea Jeanine was capable
of something like this.

523
00:58:15,810 --> 00:58:18,180
It's time we fight back.

524
00:58:18,290 --> 00:58:19,939
-We don't have the numbers.
-We will.

525
00:58:21,793 --> 00:58:23,270
Once we get the Factionless.

526
00:58:28,136 --> 00:58:29,146
You heard Eric.

527
00:58:29,814 --> 00:58:34,200
Jeanine is not gonna stop coming after you.
It's are only option.

528
00:58:40,147 --> 00:58:44,192
Tris Prior. Of course.

529
00:58:44,193 --> 00:58:46,246
It had to be her.

530
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:49,625
-Is she still off the grid?
-Yeah.

531
00:58:50,010 --> 00:58:52,111
But I think I found a solution.

532
00:58:56,020 --> 00:58:58,707
-It's Peter, right?
-Yeah.

533
00:58:59,290 --> 00:59:03,270
Jeanine, can I just say it's truly an honor
to finally meet you in person.

534
00:59:05,206 --> 00:59:06,382
Congratulations mother.

535
00:59:07,784 --> 00:59:09,037
You got your war.

536
00:59:09,550 --> 00:59:13,558
-I know you wish there was another way.
-But there isn't.

537
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:18,909
I'm the lesser of two evils, is that it?

538
00:59:24,870 --> 00:59:27,750
-It better be.
-Tell me...

539
00:59:28,890 --> 00:59:30,724
Why did you surrender to Erudite?

540
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:34,280
What do you want?

541
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,570
I would like a position in your regime.

542
00:59:39,670 --> 00:59:43,197
Ideally I would like a position with
some advancement opportunities.

543
00:59:44,830 --> 00:59:46,832
I may be Dauntless but I'm not just some meathead.

544
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:50,651
No offense, Max.

545
00:59:54,820 --> 00:59:57,138
Prove your worth to us.

546
00:59:58,170 --> 01:00:00,143
Then we can discuss your ambitions.

547
01:00:00,510 --> 01:00:01,910
Great.

548
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:04,180
When do I start?

549
01:00:04,210 --> 01:00:06,610
Let's talk about your friend Tris Prior.

550
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:11,470
-How do I flush her out?
-It's simple.

551
01:00:11,471 --> 01:00:14,303
The girl is a walking bleeding heart.
She was borne out of Abegnation.

552
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:16,960
It's her weak spot. You just have to know how to press it.

553
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:20,029
Help! Come quick.

554
01:00:30,196 --> 01:00:34,733
Traitor Tris Prior must be surrendered to Erudite.

555
01:00:34,734 --> 01:00:37,275
Or every day more death will follow.

556
01:00:43,526 --> 01:00:44,619
Hand over Tris Prior.

557
01:00:45,955 --> 01:00:48,080
Or every day more death will follow.

558
01:00:50,970 --> 01:00:52,844
Hand over Tris Prior.

559
01:00:53,333 --> 01:00:55,872
Or every day more death will follow.

560
01:01:00,654 --> 01:01:02,062
Hand over Tris Prior.

561
01:01:02,262 --> 01:01:04,858
-Or every day more death will follow.
-Christina!

562
01:01:05,058 --> 01:01:06,058
No!

563
01:01:19,060 --> 01:01:20,500
Christina!

564
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:22,610
Help me!

565
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:24,570
Tris!

566
01:02:01,521 --> 01:02:03,725
We removed this from the body of the suicidal.

567
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:08,243
Marlene. Her name was Marlene.

568
01:02:08,859 --> 01:02:11,661
I'm sorry. Marlene.

569
01:02:12,648 --> 01:02:14,959
It's a very sophisticated sim serum injector.

570
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:17,100
It also has a radio transmitter in it's head.

571
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:20,415
-How do we get them out?
 -I don't know.

572
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:22,855
This tech was built to defend itself.

573
01:02:23,090 --> 01:02:24,240
This tendril...

574
01:02:25,260 --> 01:02:27,232
wraps around the nearest major artery.

575
01:02:27,260 --> 01:02:31,662
If you try to removed them...
and it kills the host.

576
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:33,410
Kill the host?

577
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:37,467
So what do we do?

578
01:02:37,468 --> 01:02:40,659
Tori must neutralize the disk before we do anything else.

579
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:42,706
Or we can do the logical thing.

580
01:02:43,150 --> 01:02:44,580
We hand her over.

581
01:02:44,890 --> 01:02:49,133
Nobody knows about this alliance,
we have to protect that advantage.

582
01:02:49,134 --> 01:02:50,790
If we hand Tris over now...

583
01:02:51,820 --> 01:02:54,319
it might buy some time.

584
01:03:02,721 --> 01:03:04,073
I think it's a good idea.

585
01:03:04,620 --> 01:03:07,384
But you have to go through me first.

586
01:03:07,685 --> 01:03:10,040
-Me too.
-And us.

587
01:03:22,774 --> 01:03:25,278
I am the one with a time bomb in my arm!

588
01:03:56,037 --> 01:03:57,900
I know what you're thinking.

589
01:04:00,742 --> 01:04:02,505
But I'm not gonna let you do it.

590
01:04:09,976 --> 01:04:12,196
I can't let anyone else die because of me.

591
01:04:12,534 --> 01:04:14,631
No one else is gonna die because of you.

592
01:04:15,091 --> 01:04:17,059
Tori will disable the disk.

593
01:04:17,259 --> 01:04:20,452
-And if she doesn't?
-Then...

594
01:04:22,893 --> 01:04:26,706
If she doesn't, we figure it out.

595
01:04:27,991 --> 01:04:29,093
Together.

596
01:04:30,153 --> 01:04:31,796
You know, I'm just one person.

597
01:04:35,045 --> 01:04:37,661
-I'm not worth it.
-You are worth it.

598
01:04:37,861 --> 01:04:39,811
You are more than worth it to me.

599
01:04:41,566 --> 01:04:43,246
I love you.

600
01:06:53,471 --> 01:06:56,983
This city may be safe behind a closed wall,

601
01:06:57,457 --> 01:07:02,149
but make no mistake, that wall alone
doesnt ensure our security.

602
01:07:04,145 --> 01:07:11,022
It's up to us, everyone of us, to remain
vigilant and isolate any threat against us.

603
01:07:12,274 --> 01:07:16,383
There are individuals hiding among
us who must be contained.

604
01:07:17,190 --> 01:07:21,059
Permit me to address the objections from
my fellow faction leaders.

605
01:07:22,123 --> 01:07:25,746
I'm aware that there has been some concerns
about the unavoidable raid on Candor

606
01:07:25,747 --> 01:07:29,297
so let me be clear.

607
01:07:30,849 --> 01:07:34,278
The harbouring of Divergents from any faction

608
01:07:34,279 --> 01:07:36,186
can not be tolerated.

609
01:07:37,975 --> 01:07:43,751
Very soon I will present what I believe to be no less
than a mandates from the founders themselves.

610
01:07:44,626 --> 01:07:49,916
On this I have no doubt on the measure I have taken to keep the peace.

611
01:07:50,609 --> 01:07:55,068
I have provided instructions that will allow
us to eradicate the Divergence crisis

612
01:07:55,069 --> 01:07:56,892
Once and for all.

613
01:08:12,043 --> 01:08:13,573
Where are you going?

614
01:08:14,439 --> 01:08:16,078
She has left. She's gone.

615
01:08:17,582 --> 01:08:19,871
What? When?

616
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:22,078
-Last night.
-Wait.

617
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:29,559
Tobias! People look to you for leadership.

618
01:08:29,670 --> 01:08:31,920
You can't just abandon them

619
01:08:36,826 --> 01:08:37,941
Tobias!

620
01:08:47,700 --> 01:08:48,750
Wow!

621
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:52,857
I have to admit that I'm surprised.

622
01:08:54,184 --> 01:08:56,143
I mean, I know that you are dumb but..

623
01:08:56,480 --> 01:08:59,829
I didn't think you were dumb enough
to actually come down here.

624
01:09:00,030 --> 01:09:01,589
And turn yourself in.

625
01:09:07,358 --> 01:09:08,840
The killings had to stop.

626
01:09:09,911 --> 01:09:13,247
That just shows that you can take the girl from Abnigation

627
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:15,581
but you cant take Abnigation out of her.

628
01:09:16,150 --> 01:09:18,300
Let's go.

629
01:09:18,900 --> 01:09:21,399
Once a stiff, always a stiff. Right?

630
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:35,820
-What is this?
-What is this? This is the whole reason you are locked Tris.

631
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:39,620
Man I love knowing stuff you don't.

632
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:42,580
I need you to open that box Tris.

633
01:09:48,450 --> 01:09:51,816
The only way to open that box is to
pass the sims of all five factions.

634
01:09:53,770 --> 01:09:57,002
But te only people who have
tried to it so far have died.

635
01:10:00,744 --> 01:10:02,514
I don't think I was supposed to tell you that.

636
01:10:03,007 --> 01:10:04,114
Well...

637
01:10:05,140 --> 01:10:06,790
No pressure.

638
01:10:07,619 --> 01:10:08,959
Remarkable!

639
01:10:10,124 --> 01:10:14,475
The chances of it being you of all people.

640
01:10:15,330 --> 01:10:17,800
You're the...laws of probability.

641
01:10:21,373 --> 01:10:23,700
As remarkable as many people you managed to murder?

642
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:28,902
Dark times call for extrme measures.

643
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:33,847
You may find it hard to believe.

644
01:10:33,917 --> 01:10:36,456
But I'm serving the greater good.

645
01:10:38,950 --> 01:10:40,640
Step up on the disc please.

646
01:11:02,130 --> 01:11:04,340
Step up on the disc please.

647
01:11:12,460 --> 01:11:13,640
Mam?

648
01:11:22,550 --> 01:11:25,299
Stop the suicides or I swear I will shoot him.

649
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:30,309
That's okey. You can kill him if you want,
we have plenty of guards.

650
01:11:31,877 --> 01:11:33,209
What?

651
01:12:11,229 --> 01:12:16,311
I'm guesing you need me alive
for this to work. Right?

652
01:12:18,990 --> 01:12:20,220
Right?!

653
01:12:33,285 --> 01:12:35,489
Tris.

654
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:39,760
Caleb.

655
01:12:41,687 --> 01:12:43,060
Caleb.

656
01:12:43,380 --> 01:12:46,960
Don't engage to subject.

657
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:49,890
Conditions are already less then optimal.

658
01:12:59,610 --> 01:13:00,710
My God.

659
01:13:11,530 --> 01:13:14,381
If I do this the suicides stop?

660
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:20,491
No. The suicides will continue.

661
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:24,488
Until you suced and pass all five sims.

662
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:28,451
That should be sufficient enough.

663
01:13:31,270 --> 01:13:32,480
Good luck.

664
01:14:44,445 --> 01:14:45,565
Let's begin.

665
01:14:47,845 --> 01:14:49,809
Initialize the Dauntless sim.

666
01:15:09,597 --> 01:15:12,820
Mom.

667
01:15:15,787 --> 01:15:17,000
Tris, help me!

668
01:15:47,442 --> 01:15:49,252
Heart rate is rising.

669
01:15:50,782 --> 01:15:52,098
Keep her in play.

670
01:16:11,630 --> 01:16:12,820
Mom!

671
01:16:22,986 --> 01:16:24,686
I'm coming.

672
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,966
Mom!

673
01:17:06,166 --> 01:17:07,666
I'm coming.

674
01:17:53,483 --> 01:17:54,855
Tris!

675
01:17:55,688 --> 01:17:57,245
Hold on!

676
01:18:08,074 --> 01:18:09,417
Tris.

677
01:18:11,256 --> 01:18:13,224
Dauntless sim complete.

678
01:18:27,724 --> 01:18:31,256
-I miss you so much.
-I know you do.

679
01:18:32,781 --> 01:18:34,447
But I'm still with you..

680
01:18:45,857 --> 01:18:47,610
You need to be strong now.

681
01:18:49,103 --> 01:18:50,863
Tell me you're gonna be strong.

682
01:18:51,408 --> 01:18:53,441
-I'm trying.
-You can do this.

683
01:18:53,766 --> 01:18:55,554
I know you can.

684
01:18:56,218 --> 01:19:00,412
You're brave. Braver than anyone.

685
01:19:01,895 --> 01:19:03,987
I'm not brave mom.

686
01:19:06,898 --> 01:19:09,214
I pretend that I am.

687
01:19:10,180 --> 01:19:13,049
I want people to think that I am, but I'm not.

688
01:19:17,074 --> 01:19:19,879
I'm really really scared and...

689
01:19:20,540 --> 01:19:23,571
Maybe we are actually what's wrong in this world.

690
01:19:25,203 --> 01:19:27,070
Divergents.

691
01:19:28,350 --> 01:19:31,082
I never wanted any of this.

692
01:19:31,950 --> 01:19:35,360
You and dad and Caleb and Four.

693
01:19:36,175 --> 01:19:42,711
I can't help but think that if I was normal
we would all still be together.

694
01:19:44,534 --> 01:19:47,476
Mom, I don't want to be Divergent anymore.

695
01:19:47,477 --> 01:19:50,662
I just want to feel safe again.

696
01:19:53,519 --> 01:19:55,793
Candor sim complete.

697
01:20:15,759 --> 01:20:18,529
Four. You're here?

698
01:20:18,729 --> 01:20:20,173
Yeah, I'm here.

699
01:20:22,257 --> 01:20:23,954
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

700
01:20:25,350 --> 01:20:26,860
Secure the hallway.

701
01:20:30,740 --> 01:20:32,106
Let's get you out of here.

702
01:20:34,004 --> 01:20:35,181
-You good?
-Yeah.

703
01:20:49,869 --> 01:20:51,736
Stop. Let him go.

704
01:20:52,517 --> 01:20:54,044
Wait, you're not gonna shoot me?

705
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:56,834
Once a stiff, always a stiff.

706
01:21:09,605 --> 01:21:10,680
Go!

707
01:21:17,500 --> 01:21:20,729
Four, how did you get passed security?

708
01:21:20,730 --> 01:21:23,373
You know me, scary boyfriend skills.

709
01:21:28,114 --> 01:21:29,317
What is it?

710
01:21:32,343 --> 01:21:35,521
You weren't there. You didn't even hear that.

711
01:21:37,511 --> 01:21:38,721
Tris.

712
01:21:39,260 --> 01:21:41,040
We need to leave now. Alright?

713
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:44,013
I'm sorry Four.

714
01:21:44,797 --> 01:21:47,882
-What?
-I'm sorry I didn't tell you I was gonna go.

715
01:21:49,030 --> 01:21:51,957
I wanted to say goodbye, but I just didnt know how.

716
01:21:52,157 --> 01:21:55,026
-I didn't know how.
-What are you talking about?

717
01:21:58,980 --> 01:22:05,407
Even though I didn't get to say it in real life,
at least I get to say it now.

718
01:22:05,843 --> 01:22:10,000
-Even if it is just a sim.
-Tris, we're not in a sim.

719
01:22:10,710 --> 01:22:17,036
-Don't you think I would know if I were in a sim?
-Four....you're not in a sim.

720
01:22:19,804 --> 01:22:23,492
- You're the sim.
-Wait, wait.

721
01:22:56,183 --> 01:22:58,060
Erudite sim complete.

722
01:22:58,920 --> 01:23:02,726
-There's only Amity now.
-She hasn't passed Abnegation yet.

723
01:23:02,727 --> 01:23:05,720
Yes she has. When she spared your life.

724
01:23:07,944 --> 01:23:10,149
This girl is extraordinary.

725
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:13,706
She tested positive for four factions in one day.

726
01:23:16,277 --> 01:23:18,034
No one has gotten that far.

727
01:23:19,630 --> 01:23:20,840
We got a problem.

728
01:23:26,420 --> 01:23:28,646
She's crashing. We have to rest her.

729
01:23:29,730 --> 01:23:32,474
Are you sure you're not letting
familiar attachment cloud your judgement?

730
01:23:32,830 --> 01:23:34,177
See for yourself.

731
01:23:42,230 --> 01:23:43,290
Very well.

732
01:23:45,530 --> 01:23:47,116
Detach the subject.

733
01:23:58,420 --> 01:24:01,722
Good work, gentlemen. We will resume tomorrow.

734
01:24:44,367 --> 01:24:47,477
You were never planing on going
back to Abnegation, were you?

735
01:24:50,343 --> 01:24:52,362
I had to do what I though was right.

736
01:24:53,272 --> 01:24:55,605
My parents would be ashamed of you.

737
01:24:56,937 --> 01:25:02,287
Well maybe not. I mean I'm willing to sacrifice you.

738
01:25:03,410 --> 01:25:05,015
The only family I have left.

739
01:25:05,115 --> 01:25:08,343
The only person that I love.
In order to preserve what's best for everyone else.

740
01:25:11,218 --> 01:25:12,878
What's more selfless than that?

741
01:25:21,666 --> 01:25:24,837
What does Jeanine think is in that box Caleb?

742
01:25:25,205 --> 01:25:26,779
It's a message from the founders.

743
01:25:27,282 --> 01:25:31,573
But the box was to be opened
only if the factions broke down.

744
01:25:31,574 --> 01:25:33,831
Which is why we require someone like you to open it.

745
01:25:35,111 --> 01:25:39,093
You're living proof that the Divergent problem
has grown beyond all control.

746
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:41,999
Do you even hear what you are saying right now?

747
01:25:43,250 --> 01:25:46,135
No one think it's your fault that you were born this way.

748
01:25:46,351 --> 01:25:48,609
Jeanine murdered an entire faction Caleb.

749
01:25:48,610 --> 01:25:50,856
That faction could no longer be trusted.

750
01:25:50,857 --> 01:25:52,141
She killed our parents.

751
01:25:52,142 --> 01:25:54,761
Are parents brought that on themselves.

752
01:25:54,961 --> 01:25:55,961
What are you talking about?

753
01:25:57,495 --> 01:25:59,750
The box, it was in their house.

754
01:25:59,751 --> 01:26:01,653
They were the ones hiding it.

755
01:26:01,654 --> 01:26:03,755
All those lives could have been spared.

756
01:26:05,789 --> 01:26:08,063
Seems we didnt knew our parents
as well as we thought we did.

757
01:26:11,070 --> 01:26:13,690
Alright family reunion is over, it's time to go.

758
01:26:21,897 --> 01:26:24,249
I got a little surprise for you Tris.

759
01:26:28,226 --> 01:26:29,888
-Four!
-Tris!

760
01:26:30,195 --> 01:26:34,023
Tris!

761
01:26:34,223 --> 01:26:39,521
Four!

762
01:26:46,950 --> 01:26:52,346
I gather your brother explained how vital the
work you're doing here is to the future of the city.

763
01:26:52,546 --> 01:26:53,911
Please just let Four go.

764
01:26:55,490 --> 01:27:00,395
If his well being is such a concern you
should focus on the task at hand.

765
01:27:02,898 --> 01:27:05,589
Tell me...
Do you appreciate irony?

766
01:27:06,650 --> 01:27:11,254
You tested positive for Erudite so
you must have the intellectual capacity.

767
01:27:11,657 --> 01:27:12,754
Irony.

768
01:27:12,755 --> 01:27:17,050
For instance. Right now you are full of hate,
but you need to pass an Amity sim.

769
01:27:22,124 --> 01:27:24,711
Then there are other ironies at work too.

770
01:27:25,070 --> 01:27:27,463
-Such as the fact your cherish mother...
-Don't.

771
01:27:27,464 --> 01:27:31,804
that you so dauntlessly saved in the sim is
the reason you're in this mess to begin with.

772
01:27:31,805 --> 01:27:33,223
You're the reason I'm in this mess.

773
01:27:33,224 --> 01:27:36,261
-And then there the most pointed irony of all.
-Stop.

774
01:27:36,262 --> 01:27:40,861
That Nathalie Prior not only died trying
to protect the data that I now have.

775
01:27:40,862 --> 01:27:42,914
Because you stole them. You killed her for it!

776
01:27:42,915 --> 01:27:47,911
Data that she so selfishly withheld. But her own daughter,

777
01:27:47,912 --> 01:27:52,308
her beloved Divergent Tris is going to
be the one who delivered it to me.

778
01:27:52,309 --> 01:27:53,380
-I said stop!
-Therefore...

779
01:27:54,244 --> 01:27:58,101
your mother's death, just like
your boyfriend's death....

780
01:27:58,102 --> 01:28:00,955
will mean absolutely nothing.

781
01:29:09,093 --> 01:29:13,672
Don't pull her out. Not yet.

782
01:30:04,779 --> 01:30:06,800
No!

783
01:30:07,930 --> 01:30:09,134
Bring her back!

784
01:30:12,190 --> 01:30:13,530
Bring her back

785
01:30:15,190 --> 01:30:16,530
Now!

786
01:30:17,426 --> 01:30:18,662
Bring her back!

787
01:30:18,862 --> 01:30:20,261
Come on!

788
01:30:20,461 --> 01:30:22,464
Come on!

789
01:30:26,172 --> 01:30:27,311
Bring her back!

790
01:30:27,440 --> 01:30:29,236
Test subject seven is no longer viable.

791
01:30:53,480 --> 01:30:55,514
I really thought you were the one.

792
01:31:07,877 --> 01:31:08,977
We just...

793
01:31:11,910 --> 01:31:15,650
We just have to resume are search.

794
01:31:30,458 --> 01:31:32,956
Find solace in your faction, Caleb.

795
01:31:33,349 --> 01:31:35,257
We are your family now.

796
01:32:21,988 --> 01:32:23,688
Jeanine wanted me to show you this.

797
01:32:53,410 --> 01:32:55,751
Hey, Four, can you do that thing you do?

798
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:04,370
Hey Four, that's pretty good right?

799
01:33:04,545 --> 01:33:09,142
First I stole paralytic from infirmary then I shot her up
when she was freaking out about you.

800
01:33:09,210 --> 01:33:12,635
I mean I told these guys I was pretty smart.
I guess they should've listened.

801
01:33:18,821 --> 01:33:22,508
-You're real!
-Yeah I'm real.

802
01:33:24,605 --> 01:33:29,520
-What are you doing here?
-You die, I die.

803
01:33:33,170 --> 01:33:37,411
ohh....okay guys come on. Lets go, seriously.
You can do that later.

804
01:33:38,375 --> 01:33:39,849
-You're ok?
-Yeah.

805
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,778
-Thank you, Peter.
-Yeah whatever. No we're even, stiff.

806
01:33:47,484 --> 01:33:48,578
Alright, come on let's go.

807
01:33:48,778 --> 01:33:51,126
-Before Jeanine realizes we're gone.
-

808
01:33:51,900 --> 01:33:54,002
-What?
-The box! We have to get the box!

809
01:33:54,003 --> 01:33:56,133
Are you kidding me?
Now is not the time for souvenir tris!

810
01:33:56,134 --> 01:33:57,531
Four, you have to listen to me.

811
01:33:57,770 --> 01:34:00,779
It's not what Jeanine think it is, I know it's not.
My mother would have destroyed it.

812
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:03,325
We have to get it.

813
01:34:06,780 --> 01:34:09,207
Peter, is there another way to the lab?

814
01:34:09,900 --> 01:34:12,855
I mean, I have to go to the control
room to disable all the doors.

815
01:34:12,856 --> 01:34:14,282
Okay you do that!

816
01:34:16,460 --> 01:34:18,009
-Okay, right now?
-Yeah.

817
01:34:18,270 --> 01:34:20,539
You just choose our side
whether you meant to or not.

818
01:34:20,849 --> 01:34:23,117
If you want to survive, make sure we do.

819
01:34:24,280 --> 01:34:25,320
Let's go!

820
01:34:28,245 --> 01:34:28,745
Fuck!

821
01:34:57,998 --> 01:35:00,497
No guns. It draws less attention.

822
01:35:02,526 --> 01:35:04,572
-Hey.
-Hold up!

823
01:35:15,335 --> 01:35:16,915
- Access Denied.
- Come on!

824
01:35:44,553 --> 01:35:46,786
- Access granted.
- Let's go..

825
01:35:49,193 --> 01:35:50,830
-Is that it?
-Yes.

826
01:35:50,919 --> 01:35:52,569
Grab it and let's go.

827
01:35:55,885 --> 01:35:59,865
-Security breach.
-What's going on?

828
01:36:02,600 --> 01:36:04,906
-What's going on? What is it?
-There's been a breach in the sim room.

829
01:36:04,907 --> 01:36:07,051
I want to see who the hell is in there.

830
01:36:07,052 --> 01:36:09,041
-The cameras are down in that sector.
-I'll send the guards there.

831
01:36:09,042 --> 01:36:11,938
Bring up every cell!

832
01:36:11,939 --> 01:36:13,080
Now!

833
01:36:20,081 --> 01:36:21,179
Show her.

834
01:36:22,030 --> 01:36:24,141
Tori finally found a way to get them out safely.

835
01:36:24,142 --> 01:36:27,440
- How many others?
- Every last one of them.

836
01:36:31,454 --> 01:36:32,530
Let's go!

837
01:36:36,352 --> 01:36:39,587
Tris! Tris, come on, we gotta move.

838
01:36:40,970 --> 01:36:42,410
Tris we have to move!

839
01:36:43,270 --> 01:36:46,005
I can't!, i can't

840
01:36:46,293 --> 01:36:48,837
My mom died protecting what ever is inside this.

841
01:36:50,680 --> 01:36:53,086
I have to open it for her and I think I know how.

842
01:36:53,087 --> 01:36:56,556
-If we dont leave here now we're not getting out.
-I have to do this first.

843
01:36:57,150 --> 01:36:59,866
I know it doesn't make much sense
but you have to trust me, please.

844
01:37:01,850 --> 01:37:03,643
You have my life apparently.

845
01:37:10,020 --> 01:37:11,434
Get in.

846
01:37:16,186 --> 01:37:17,260
Don't move!

847
01:37:22,849 --> 01:37:24,625
Initializing Amity sim.

848
01:37:29,070 --> 01:37:30,775
Back again are we.

849
01:37:32,066 --> 01:37:34,460
You're an even bigger fool than your mother.

850
01:37:39,200 --> 01:37:41,480
You can say whatever you want Jeanine.

851
01:37:42,604 --> 01:37:44,318
But I'm not gonna fight you.

852
01:37:45,154 --> 01:37:47,825
-How very Amity of you.
-I mean it.

853
01:37:50,009 --> 01:37:53,043
-I'm not gonna fight you.
-Of course you're not.

854
01:37:54,040 --> 01:37:56,239
You're gonna fight her.

855
01:37:59,030 --> 01:38:00,886
The one you really hate.

856
01:38:33,568 --> 01:38:34,837
What are you?

857
01:38:37,767 --> 01:38:39,808
I'm you, Tris.

858
01:38:41,031 --> 01:38:43,225
I'm the real you.

859
01:38:53,581 --> 01:38:54,753
I'm not gonna fight you.

860
01:38:55,205 --> 01:38:57,188
-I'll make you fight me.
-You're not me.

861
01:38:57,189 --> 01:39:00,622
I am. I'm what the others see
when they're looking at you.

862
01:39:16,642 --> 01:39:20,300
You killed Will and your parents. You're deadly.

863
01:39:21,085 --> 01:39:22,200
Enough!

864
01:39:26,505 --> 01:39:30,464
No one's gonna love you Tris.
They're not even gonna miss you.

865
01:39:30,465 --> 01:39:32,720
This world will only be better off without you.

866
01:39:32,920 --> 01:39:35,560
One less Divergent ruining things.

867
01:39:35,670 --> 01:39:41,755
And no one will ever forgive you for what you've done.

868
01:39:42,639 --> 01:39:43,952
You're wrong.

869
01:39:51,917 --> 01:39:55,186
Because I will.

870
01:40:31,952 --> 01:40:34,337
Amity sim complete.

871
01:40:37,890 --> 01:40:39,546
-No!
-No! Stop!

872
01:40:43,902 --> 01:40:46,493
Initializing message.

873
01:41:05,280 --> 01:41:06,470
Hello.

874
01:41:07,040 --> 01:41:08,881
I come from outside the wall.

875
01:41:09,650 --> 01:41:12,252
Where we have all destroyed each other.

876
01:41:12,770 --> 01:41:16,578
We designed your city as an experiment.

877
01:41:17,204 --> 01:41:21,334
We believed it was the only way to recover
the humanity we had lost.

878
01:41:23,965 --> 01:41:27,091
And we created factions to ensure peace.

879
01:41:28,463 --> 01:41:33,108
We believed that there will be those among
you who will transcend these factions.

880
01:41:34,530 --> 01:41:36,837
These will be the Divergent.

881
01:41:38,777 --> 01:41:41,330
They are the true purpose of the experiment.

882
01:41:41,331 --> 01:41:45,996
They are vital to humanity's survival.

883
01:41:47,540 --> 01:41:52,830
If you're watching this now than at least one of
you are proof that our experiment has succeeded.

884
01:41:54,370 --> 01:42:00,521
The time has come for you to emerge
from your isolation and rejoin us.

885
01:42:00,640 --> 01:42:04,018
We have allowed you to believe that you're the last of us,

886
01:42:04,019 --> 01:42:05,808
but you're not.

887
01:42:06,390 --> 01:42:11,150
Mankind waits for you, with hope,

888
01:42:11,350 --> 01:42:13,677
beyond the wall.

889
01:42:21,113 --> 01:42:23,636
- you're okay?
-Yeah.

890
01:42:27,403 --> 01:42:28,503
Yes.

891
01:42:46,042 --> 01:42:48,544
You're wrong about us.

892
01:42:52,381 --> 01:42:57,642
We were never the problem. We're the solution.

893
01:43:09,899 --> 01:43:12,478
-Bury the box.
-What?

894
01:43:12,479 --> 01:43:15,301
No one sees it. Ever.

895
01:43:18,863 --> 01:43:20,312
Kill them both.

896
01:43:20,370 --> 01:43:21,507
No!

897
01:43:28,670 --> 01:43:29,830
Don't move.

898
01:43:34,420 --> 01:43:36,919
Put your weapons down now!

899
01:43:36,920 --> 01:43:41,380
-Stay!
-Do not move!

900
01:43:45,203 --> 01:43:46,648
Hello, Jeanine.

901
01:43:48,269 --> 01:43:49,492
Evelyn.

902
01:43:49,493 --> 01:43:51,370
Impressive.

903
01:43:51,530 --> 01:43:53,337
I think we're gonna like it here.

904
01:43:54,220 --> 01:43:57,130
Do you honestly think the other
factions will stand for this?

905
01:43:57,710 --> 01:43:59,719
Because you're so popular?

906
01:44:02,160 --> 01:44:03,710
Get her out of here.

907
01:44:04,500 --> 01:44:08,598
When that message gets out it will be the end.

908
01:44:26,290 --> 01:44:28,010
What message?

909
01:44:31,560 --> 01:44:36,021
You'll see. I'm gonna put it on every monitor in the city.

910
01:44:38,389 --> 01:44:41,059
We have seperated you from the rest of us.

911
01:44:43,030 --> 01:44:46,282
And we created factions to ensure peace.

912
01:44:48,175 --> 01:44:52,772
The time has come for you to emerge
from your isolation and rejoin us.

913
01:44:54,116 --> 01:44:57,671
We have allowed you to believe that you're the last of us,

914
01:44:57,850 --> 01:44:59,098
but you're not.

915
01:44:59,673 --> 01:45:05,887
If you're watching this now than at least one of
you are proof that our experiment has succeeded.

916
01:45:08,780 --> 01:45:12,918
Mankind waits for you, with hope,

917
01:45:13,744 --> 01:45:16,795
beyond the wall.

918
01:45:52,953 --> 01:45:54,586
These will be the Divergent.

919
01:45:54,587 --> 01:45:57,227
They are the true purpose of the experiment.

920
01:45:57,228 --> 01:46:00,787
They are vital to humanity's survival.

921
01:46:01,080 --> 01:46:02,420
You did it.

922
01:46:10,950 --> 01:46:13,249
Everyone's staring at me.

923
01:46:14,020 --> 01:46:15,830
You changed everything.

924
01:46:17,984 --> 01:46:19,382
What now?

925
01:46:20,513 --> 01:46:22,283
Only one way to find out.

926
01:46:23,420 --> 01:46:24,420
Are you ready?

927
01:47:29,119 --> 01:47:31,293
It's been over 200 years.

928
01:47:34,418 --> 01:47:36,023
Who knows what's out there?

929
01:47:38,862 --> 01:47:40,558
You'll never find out.
