00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:52,349
Have you ever felt like
you were a little bit different?

3
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:55,386
Like you had something unique
to offer the world...

4
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:58,683
...if you could just get people
to see it.

5
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:04,159
Then you know exactly how it felt...

6
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:06,389
...to be me.

7
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:07,760
Go ahead, Flint.

8
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:14,303
What is the number one problem
facing our community today?

9
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:16,298
Untied shoelaces.

10
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:21,880
Which is why I've invented
a laceless alternative foot covering.

11
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:24,312
Spray-On Shoes.

12
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:30,122
- Voilà.
- They're so nifty.

13
00:01:30,957 --> 00:01:33,016
How you gonna get them off, nerd?

14
00:01:36,996 --> 00:01:40,898
What a freak.
He wants to be smart, but that's lame.

15
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:49,467
I wanted to run away that day.

16
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:53,506
But you can't run away
from your own feet.

17
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:06,220
Not every sardine is meant
to swim, son.

18
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:09,753
I don't understand
fishing metaphors.

19
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:12,193
- What did I say?
- Don't worry.

20
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:18,163
Honey, I think your shoes
are wonderful.

21
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:20,636
Everyone just thinks I'm a weirdo.

22
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,172
So?

23
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:25,311
People probably thought
that these guys were weirdoes too.

24
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:28,544
But that never stopped them.

25
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:33,152
I was saving this
for your birthday, but here.

26
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:36,117
A professional-grade lab coat.

27
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:38,189
Just like the real guys wear.

28
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,893
It fits perfect.

29
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:45,030
The world needs
your originality, Flint.

30
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:48,891
You just have to grow into it.

31
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:52,697
And I know that you're gonna do
big things someday.

32
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:17,786
From that moment on...

33
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:21,263
...I was determined
to invent something great.

34
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:24,267
Remote Control Television.

35
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:28,130
And, the pitch is in.

36
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:30,266
Eventually.

37
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:32,604
Hair Un-Balder.

38
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,475
Flying Car.

39
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:40,047
Monkey Thought Translator.

40
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,949
- Hungry. Hungry. Hungry.
- How wise.

41
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:46,558
No, Steve. No, no, no, no, no!
No, please! Leave it-

42
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:48,616
Ratbirds.

43
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:50,888
Hey, what's going on, little guy?

44
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,055
Flint Lockwood.

45
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:56,829
My dream was to help
my hometown...

46
00:03:57,003 --> 00:04:00,632
...a tiny island hidden under
the "A" in "Atlantic"...

47
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,736
...called Swallow Falls.

48
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:06,574
We were famous for sardines...

49
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:11,076
...until the day the Baby Brent
Sardine Cannery closed for good.

50
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:14,846
Right after everyone in the world
realized that sardines...

51
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:16,215
...are super gross.

52
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:23,687
Soon, all of us were stuck eating
the sardines that no one else wanted.

53
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:30,200
Poached, fried, boiled, dried,
candied and juiced.

54
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,735
Life became gray and flavourless.

55
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:38,104
But when all seemed lost,
I stared at defeat...

56
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:40,343
...and found hope.

57
00:05:08,587 --> 00:05:11,055
My name is Flint Lockwood.

58
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:14,491
And I was about to invent
a machine...

59
00:05:14,659 --> 00:05:16,490
...that turns water...

60
00:05:16,661 --> 00:05:18,822
...into food.

61
00:05:19,731 --> 00:05:23,724
Steve, my best friend
and trusted colleague.

62
00:05:24,135 --> 00:05:25,159
Steve.

63
00:05:25,337 --> 00:05:28,067
Can I count on your help?

64
00:05:30,475 --> 00:05:31,499
Can.

65
00:05:32,844 --> 00:05:34,436
I knew I could.

66
00:05:34,613 --> 00:05:37,173
Button, on.
Memory, activate.

67
00:05:37,349 --> 00:05:41,217
Blueprints, awesome.
Begin nano-mutation.

68
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,981
Radiation matrix, secure.

69
00:05:44,556 --> 00:05:46,148
Computer, boot.

70
00:05:47,826 --> 00:05:49,987
Coolness enhancement, complete.

71
00:05:50,161 --> 00:05:51,992
Engage coffee break.

72
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,361
Networking power grid.

73
00:06:05,377 --> 00:06:08,369
Beginning conversion of water...

74
00:06:08,546 --> 00:06:10,207
...into food.

75
00:06:10,382 --> 00:06:12,441
Hydrating protein matrix.

76
00:06:12,917 --> 00:06:15,545
Calibrating flavour panel.

77
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,553
Priming chow plopper.

78
00:06:19,157 --> 00:06:22,217
Uploading cool machine voice.

79
00:06:23,595 --> 00:06:25,153
Cheeseburger.

80
00:06:26,097 --> 00:06:30,090
Everyone is going to love this.

81
00:06:55,894 --> 00:06:57,122
Flint!

82
00:06:57,295 --> 00:06:58,762
Sorry, Dad.

83
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:01,198
Steve, keep working.

84
00:07:04,602 --> 00:07:06,934
Scanning hand.

85
00:07:24,422 --> 00:07:27,016
That's a really weird dude.

86
00:07:31,496 --> 00:07:34,158
Re-energizing tower unit.

87
00:07:39,304 --> 00:07:41,363
Jeez. See you, Dad.

88
00:07:43,074 --> 00:07:44,598
Flint.

89
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,876
Don't you think it's time to give up
this inventing thing, get a real job?

90
00:07:54,052 --> 00:07:55,542
No, why?

91
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:00,157
Well, all your technology stuff,
it just ends in disaster.

92
00:08:00,325 --> 00:08:03,192
The ratbirds, yes, they escaped
and bred at a surprising rate.

93
00:08:03,361 --> 00:08:06,023
But I took care of that problem
and disposed of them.

94
00:08:06,197 --> 00:08:08,028
Billy, just play dead.

95
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:12,431
Flint, you don't keep throwing your net
where there aren't any fish.

96
00:08:12,604 --> 00:08:14,367
- What?
- I want you to work full-time...

97
00:08:14,539 --> 00:08:17,235
...at the tackle shop.
- The tackle shop? Dad, no.

98
00:08:17,408 --> 00:08:19,000
Tackle is a good career.

99
00:08:19,177 --> 00:08:20,804
Please, I'm so close with this one.

100
00:08:20,979 --> 00:08:25,109
I just have to hook it up to the power
station and give it power and it'll work.

101
00:08:25,283 --> 00:08:27,308
And then you could sell food
in the shop...

102
00:08:27,485 --> 00:08:30,249
...and then everyone won't have to eat
sardines anymore.

103
00:08:30,421 --> 00:08:34,016
It is going to be so awesome.

104
00:08:34,726 --> 00:08:36,785
I'm sorry, son.

105
00:08:36,961 --> 00:08:38,087
No more inventing.

106
00:08:38,263 --> 00:08:41,391
Dad, I know I can do this.

107
00:08:41,566 --> 00:08:42,760
And Mom did too.

108
00:08:44,969 --> 00:08:48,564
It had been almost 10 years
since Mom died...

109
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:52,073
...and Dad still didn't understand me
like she did.

110
00:08:52,243 --> 00:08:55,701
Come on. Let's open the shop.

111
00:08:58,483 --> 00:09:01,350
Tim and Son
Sardine Bait and Tackle.

112
00:09:02,821 --> 00:09:04,618
You feeling it?

113
00:09:08,059 --> 00:09:10,960
Look out, Baby Brent!

114
00:09:12,897 --> 00:09:14,421
Baby Brent Sardines.

115
00:09:14,599 --> 00:09:17,227
Hand-packed in Swallow Falls.

116
00:09:17,402 --> 00:09:22,203
As your mayor, I know it's time to put
our sardine-canning past behind us...

117
00:09:22,373 --> 00:09:24,671
...and look to the future.

118
00:09:24,843 --> 00:09:26,902
Sardine tourism!

119
00:09:28,313 --> 00:09:30,338
That's why,
without consulting anyone...

120
00:09:30,515 --> 00:09:34,144
...I spent the entire town budget
on the thing that is under this tarp...

121
00:09:34,319 --> 00:09:36,787
...which I will be unveiling today...

122
00:09:36,955 --> 00:09:38,786
...at noon.

123
00:09:38,957 --> 00:09:43,587
Featuring a live appearance
by Baby Brent himself.

124
00:09:43,761 --> 00:09:47,060
What is up, everybody?

125
00:09:47,232 --> 00:09:49,166
- Hey.
- Hey, it's Baby Brent.

126
00:09:49,334 --> 00:09:53,395
What you doing? Stacking cans
with me on them as a baby?

127
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:58,272
Anyways, who wants to watch me
cut the ribbon...

128
00:09:58,443 --> 00:10:00,035
...at the mayor's unveiling thing?

129
00:10:00,211 --> 00:10:03,942
I'll be using these bad boys
to help save the town.

130
00:10:06,517 --> 00:10:09,350
All right, you guys.
Sardines, yeah.

131
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:13,354
- Swallow Falls forever!
- What a delight.

132
00:10:13,524 --> 00:10:17,358
Listen, you- Maybe you wanna go
to that unveiling?

133
00:10:17,528 --> 00:10:21,487
You know, Dad, why don't you
go ahead. I'll hold down the fort here.

134
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:24,567
Really? You sure you can handle it?

135
00:10:24,736 --> 00:10:27,068
Yeah, Dad,
I'm pretty sure I'll be fine.

136
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:28,799
All right, then.

137
00:10:28,973 --> 00:10:31,908
I'll be back in half an hour, skipper.

138
00:10:32,076 --> 00:10:34,271
Okay. Bye.

139
00:10:42,086 --> 00:10:44,987
This hellhole is too small
for me, Brent.

140
00:10:45,156 --> 00:10:47,056
I wanna be big.

141
00:10:47,225 --> 00:10:51,685
I want people to look at me and say,
"That is one big mayor."

142
00:10:51,863 --> 00:10:53,728
And that's why this has to work.

143
00:10:53,898 --> 00:10:55,559
It has to work.

144
00:10:55,733 --> 00:10:58,896
Otherwise, I'm just a tiny mayor
of a tiny town...

145
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:02,437
...full of tiny sardine-sucking
knuckle-scrapers.

146
00:11:02,607 --> 00:11:04,074
But not me, right?

147
00:11:04,242 --> 00:11:08,736
Oh, not you, Brent. No.
You've always been like a son to me.

148
00:11:11,349 --> 00:11:13,579
Hey, everybody.

149
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:20,551
Under this tarp is the greatest tourist
attraction ever built by humans.

150
00:11:20,725 --> 00:11:23,319
We just need 17,000 more gigajoules.

151
00:11:23,494 --> 00:11:26,395
- An attraction so...
- Go, go, go.

152
00:11:27,832 --> 00:11:29,595
What are you doing, Flint Lockwood?

153
00:11:29,767 --> 00:11:32,292
Just holding my hands
behind my back respectfully, sir.

154
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:34,404
- You know what you are, Lockwood?
- No.

155
00:11:34,572 --> 00:11:36,403
A shenaniganizer.

156
00:11:36,574 --> 00:11:37,939
A tomfool.

157
00:11:38,109 --> 00:11:40,373
- You see my beautiful angel son Cal?
- What's up?

158
00:11:40,545 --> 00:11:43,036
I love him so much.
This is my only son.

159
00:11:43,214 --> 00:11:44,841
I want him to have a bright future.

160
00:11:45,016 --> 00:11:47,280
A future in which you don't ruin
our town's day...

161
00:11:47,452 --> 00:11:49,682
...with one of your
crazy science thingies.

162
00:11:49,854 --> 00:11:53,017
- Well, that's all behind me-
- You see this contact lens, Lockwood?

163
00:11:53,191 --> 00:11:55,250
- This contact lens represent you.
- All right.

164
00:11:55,426 --> 00:11:57,656
- And my eye represents my eye.
- Okay.

165
00:11:57,829 --> 00:12:02,562
I got my eye on you.

166
00:12:02,734 --> 00:12:05,999
- Oh, my gosh, a jaywalker.
- Hey.

167
00:12:06,671 --> 00:12:10,607
And I've arranged for live coverage
from a major network...

168
00:12:10,775 --> 00:12:14,336
...and their most experienced
professional reporter.

169
00:12:15,713 --> 00:12:18,546
Oh, just send the intern.
She's cute, and she's super perky.

170
00:12:18,716 --> 00:12:22,948
Well, those are the only things we look
for in a TV weatherperson. Intern.

171
00:12:23,121 --> 00:12:26,318
How would you like to do a weather
report from a rinky-dink island...

172
00:12:26,491 --> 00:12:28,982
...in the middle of the ocean
as a favour to my cousin?

173
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,218
Really?

174
00:12:30,862 --> 00:12:32,261
Can you believe it, Manny?

175
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:35,991
Temporary
professional meteorologist.

176
00:12:36,167 --> 00:12:37,725
Okay, Manny, what about this?

177
00:12:37,902 --> 00:12:39,733
Welcome, America,
I'm Sam Sparks.

178
00:12:39,904 --> 00:12:42,270
Hello, America, Sam Sparks here.

179
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,499
America, hi. I didn't see you there.

180
00:12:44,675 --> 00:12:46,040
It's me, Sam Sparks.

181
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:50,579
On my way across the ocean.

182
00:12:51,082 --> 00:12:55,712
Now, when she gets here,
I wanna see a lot of smiling faces.

183
00:12:55,887 --> 00:12:57,548
Act like, "Hey, whoa."

184
00:12:58,256 --> 00:13:01,555
This is a great idea.

185
00:13:02,226 --> 00:13:03,750
Weather News Network.

186
00:13:03,928 --> 00:13:05,555
Weather news happens...

187
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:07,061
...or not.

188
00:13:07,231 --> 00:13:08,823
Now we're over to Swallow Falls...

189
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,332
...where our intern
is on her first day on the job.

190
00:13:11,502 --> 00:13:14,164
Or should I say, first gray on the job.

191
00:13:14,338 --> 00:13:15,930
Looks pretty cloudy there, intern.

192
00:13:16,107 --> 00:13:18,041
Hello, Sam Sparks, I'm America.

193
00:13:18,576 --> 00:13:23,479
It's Swallow Falls degrees and-
Well, let's just go to the mayor.

194
00:13:23,648 --> 00:13:27,948
Thank you and welcome,
national television audience.

195
00:13:28,119 --> 00:13:32,715
You are about to witness
an historic event, undoubtedly...

196
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:39,460
And now, here to cut
the ceremonial ribbon...

197
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:44,829
...Swallow Falls' favourite son,
Baby Brent!

198
00:13:45,002 --> 00:13:46,367
He's still got it, folks.

199
00:13:46,537 --> 00:13:47,663
Yeah.

200
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:53,336
I'm the best person
in the whole town.

201
00:13:58,683 --> 00:14:01,618
Food synthesis, go.

202
00:14:03,721 --> 00:14:07,623
My chest hairs are tingling.
Something's wrong.

203
00:14:08,392 --> 00:14:13,659
Well, here it is. The attraction
the whole world has been waiting for:

204
00:14:13,831 --> 00:14:15,958
Sardine Land.

205
00:14:18,202 --> 00:14:20,329
With rides and exhibits.

206
00:14:20,505 --> 00:14:24,566
And featuring Shamo,
the world's largest sardine...

207
00:14:24,742 --> 00:14:27,973
...and his flaming hoop of glory.

208
00:14:28,846 --> 00:14:31,838
Those of you in the splash zone,
look out.

209
00:14:32,016 --> 00:14:33,142
Yeah.

210
00:14:40,191 --> 00:14:42,022
Cheeseburger.

211
00:14:42,193 --> 00:14:43,251
Flint Lockwood.

212
00:14:43,427 --> 00:14:46,658
Just a second.
I'm in the middle of a-

213
00:14:55,239 --> 00:15:01,371
Well, looks like things in Swallow Falls
are sardine to get better. For-

214
00:15:01,546 --> 00:15:03,309
What just happened to me?

215
00:15:03,481 --> 00:15:04,641
Sorry.

216
00:15:26,204 --> 00:15:28,035
No.

217
00:15:28,973 --> 00:15:30,668
You're under arrest, Flint Lockwood.

218
00:15:30,841 --> 00:15:35,278
Thank goodness you only caused
minimal damage to Sardine Land.

219
00:15:41,185 --> 00:15:42,209
Come on.

220
00:15:51,762 --> 00:15:54,253
I really shouldn't be running
with these.

221
00:15:57,702 --> 00:16:00,364
Jump, jump, jump, run, run,
jump, jump, run.

222
00:16:22,059 --> 00:16:24,653
- It's a good thing no one got hurt!
- Flint Lockwood!

223
00:16:24,829 --> 00:16:29,027
I didn't get hurt, but that does
not mean that I'm not still mad at you.

224
00:17:34,298 --> 00:17:36,528
Oh, my gosh. I am so sorry.
Are you okay?

225
00:17:36,701 --> 00:17:39,693
- I didn't get a chance to-
- It's okay, it's just pain.

226
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:41,462
Sorry, I'm not myself today.

227
00:17:41,639 --> 00:17:46,576
My whole career was ruined by some
crazy jerk riding a homemade rocket.

228
00:17:47,678 --> 00:17:49,339
Wait a minute.

229
00:17:49,513 --> 00:17:51,981
What is going on with your feet?

230
00:17:52,149 --> 00:17:54,879
Spray-On Shoes.
They don't come off.

231
00:17:55,052 --> 00:17:56,417
Cool.

232
00:17:57,288 --> 00:17:59,313
This could solve
the untied shoes epidemic.

233
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:02,550
What are they made of, some kind of
elastic biopolymer adhesive?

234
00:18:02,727 --> 00:18:04,160
Yeah.

235
00:18:04,328 --> 00:18:05,352
Exactly.

236
00:18:05,529 --> 00:18:07,258
I mean...

237
00:18:07,698 --> 00:18:11,065
Wow, they're shiny. I'm Sam.

238
00:18:12,002 --> 00:18:13,230
- Flint.
- Steve.

239
00:18:13,838 --> 00:18:16,398
- Is that a Monkey Thought Translator?
- Steve.

240
00:18:17,775 --> 00:18:22,109
Incredible.
Did you make all of this stuff?

241
00:18:22,513 --> 00:18:25,243
- You hit me with a rocket.
- You kicked me in the face.

242
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:27,509
I said I was sorry.

243
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:31,686
Do you know how hard it is
to break into the weather game?

244
00:18:31,856 --> 00:18:35,553
I spent my entire life building up
to that moment.

245
00:18:36,327 --> 00:18:38,454
You get one shot at the show.

246
00:18:38,629 --> 00:18:40,722
And if you don't make it...

247
00:18:40,898 --> 00:18:44,390
...it's back to cleaning
the barometers.

248
00:18:51,475 --> 00:18:53,136
Cheese?

249
00:18:57,581 --> 00:19:01,312
But that could only mean...

250
00:19:48,432 --> 00:19:51,333
Excited. Excited.

251
00:20:01,745 --> 00:20:03,110
My machine works.

252
00:20:04,982 --> 00:20:09,146
It really works!

253
00:20:12,189 --> 00:20:13,679
Your machine?

254
00:20:13,858 --> 00:20:15,553
Is that what that rocket was?

255
00:20:17,061 --> 00:20:18,688
Do you like it?

256
00:20:19,096 --> 00:20:20,120
I love it!

257
00:20:20,598 --> 00:20:23,032
This is just amazing.
Look at this.

258
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,998
This is the greatest weather
phenomenon in history.

259
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:28,138
Hey, aren't you a weathergirl?

260
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:33,009
Manny, get your camera.

261
00:20:48,592 --> 00:20:53,029
This just in: Our humiliated weather
intern is apparently back for more.

262
00:20:53,197 --> 00:20:56,496
Thanks, Patrick. Okay, everybody,
you are not gonna believe this one...

263
00:20:56,667 --> 00:21:01,104
...but I am standing
in the middle of a burger rain.

264
00:21:01,272 --> 00:21:02,899
You may have seen
a meteor shower...

265
00:21:03,073 --> 00:21:06,873
...but you've never seen a shower
meatier than this.

266
00:21:07,044 --> 00:21:11,174
For a town stuck eating sardines,
this is totally manna from heaven.

267
00:21:11,348 --> 00:21:14,340
This tastes significantly better
than sardines.

268
00:21:21,358 --> 00:21:24,020
This is going to be big.

269
00:21:24,194 --> 00:21:26,287
This food weather
was created intentionally...

270
00:21:26,463 --> 00:21:29,660
...by meek-ish backyard tinkerer
Flint Lockwood.

271
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:31,824
Flint Lockwood?

272
00:21:32,002 --> 00:21:33,026
Hi.

273
00:21:33,203 --> 00:21:35,262
You're under arrest
for ruining Sardine Land.

274
00:21:35,439 --> 00:21:37,031
Flint, those burgers were awesome.

275
00:21:37,207 --> 00:21:40,574
The producer called and he was like,
"Everybody loves that food weather."

276
00:21:40,744 --> 00:21:41,938
- Food weather.
- What?

277
00:21:42,112 --> 00:21:43,909
This could be bigger
than Sardine Land.

278
00:21:44,081 --> 00:21:45,844
- Can you make it rain food again?
- No.

279
00:21:46,016 --> 00:21:48,211
- I don't know if I-
- You're gonna do it again?

280
00:21:48,385 --> 00:21:49,716
You gotta be kidding.

281
00:21:49,887 --> 00:21:52,082
Please, please, please.

282
00:21:54,992 --> 00:21:56,789
- Yes.
- No.

283
00:21:56,961 --> 00:21:59,657
- Give me one more chance.
- We know this was an accident.

284
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:01,957
- I know.
- Cheeseburgers from the sky...

285
00:22:02,132 --> 00:22:03,724
...that's not natural.

286
00:22:03,901 --> 00:22:06,563
My invention could save
the whole town.

287
00:22:06,737 --> 00:22:09,331
You will be so proud of me, Dad.

288
00:22:09,506 --> 00:22:11,303
Plus...

289
00:22:11,475 --> 00:22:12,840
...there's a girl here.

290
00:22:15,145 --> 00:22:19,104
Can you look me in the eye and
tell me you've got this under control...

291
00:22:19,283 --> 00:22:21,308
...and it's not gonna end up
in a disaster?

292
00:22:22,186 --> 00:22:23,448
Yes.

293
00:22:38,035 --> 00:22:41,129
I've got this under control,
and it's not gonna end in disaster.

294
00:22:43,407 --> 00:22:45,466
- All right.
- Thanks, Dad.

295
00:22:45,643 --> 00:22:48,874
- Oh, sure.
- Okay. So, Sam...

296
00:22:49,046 --> 00:22:53,142
...this is where the magic happens.

297
00:22:54,451 --> 00:22:57,818
Lick. Lick. Lick.

298
00:22:57,988 --> 00:23:01,219
Lick. Lick. Lick.

299
00:23:02,693 --> 00:23:04,126
Welcome, Flint.

300
00:23:06,497 --> 00:23:09,057
You seriously spend
a lot of time alone.

301
00:23:09,233 --> 00:23:10,666
What?

302
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:14,567
So here's how it works.

303
00:23:14,738 --> 00:23:18,731
Water goes in the top,
and food comes out the bottom.

304
00:23:18,909 --> 00:23:20,774
When you shot it
into the stratosphere...

305
00:23:20,944 --> 00:23:24,675
...you figured it would induce a phase
change from the cumulonimbus layer?

306
00:23:24,848 --> 00:23:27,840
That's actually
a really smart observation.

307
00:23:28,018 --> 00:23:29,713
I mean...

308
00:23:30,521 --> 00:23:32,955
The clouds probably have water
in them...

309
00:23:33,123 --> 00:23:36,524
...which, I guess, is why
you shot it up there in the first place.

310
00:23:36,694 --> 00:23:38,821
Right, right. That's why I did that.

311
00:23:38,996 --> 00:23:40,987
- On purpose.
- Right. Yeah.

312
00:23:41,165 --> 00:23:42,894
- Right.
- Of course.

313
00:23:44,435 --> 00:23:45,993
Okay.

314
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:49,264
The machine uses a principle
of hydro-genetic mutation.

315
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,432
Water molecules are bombarded
with microwave radiation...

316
00:23:52,609 --> 00:23:56,067
...which mutates their genetic recipe
into any kind of food you want.

317
00:23:56,246 --> 00:23:57,406
So...

318
00:23:57,581 --> 00:23:58,605
- Pizza?
- Yes.

319
00:23:58,782 --> 00:23:59,908
- Mashed potatoes?
- Yes.

320
00:24:00,084 --> 00:24:01,551
- Peas?
- Yes, that's also a food.

321
00:24:01,719 --> 00:24:02,947
- Steak? Apples?
- Yes.

322
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,553
- Apple sauce? BLT?
- Yes.

323
00:24:04,722 --> 00:24:06,883
- I said any kind of food.
- Chicken wings?

324
00:24:07,057 --> 00:24:09,719
Think about what you're saying,
and if it's a food, yes.

325
00:24:09,893 --> 00:24:12,191
- Baloney.
- Baloney. That is a food.

326
00:24:12,362 --> 00:24:14,626
- How about Jell-O?
- Do you like Jell-O?

327
00:24:14,798 --> 00:24:16,265
I love Jell-O.

328
00:24:16,433 --> 00:24:18,833
I love Jell-O too.
Oh, and peanut butter, right?

329
00:24:19,002 --> 00:24:21,402
Oh, no, no, no,
I am severely allergic to peanuts.

330
00:24:21,572 --> 00:24:22,596
Hey, me too.

331
00:24:22,773 --> 00:24:24,365
- What's it called?
- Peanut allergy.

332
00:24:24,541 --> 00:24:25,599
- No, the machine.
- Of course.

333
00:24:26,176 --> 00:24:28,974
It's called the Flint Lockwood
Diatonic Super-Mutating...

334
00:24:29,146 --> 00:24:31,273
...Dynamic Food Replicator.

335
00:24:31,448 --> 00:24:33,109
Or, for short:

336
00:24:33,283 --> 00:24:35,046
The FLDSMDFR.

337
00:24:35,552 --> 00:24:36,644
Fliminadifiser?

338
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:38,151
FLDSMDFR.

339
00:24:38,322 --> 00:24:39,721
Fliminubahdibferer?

340
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:41,517
Fli.

341
00:24:41,692 --> 00:24:43,455
Suh.

342
00:24:43,727 --> 00:24:44,989
Fdiferf.

343
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:49,231
Manny, make sure you get this.
He's gonna make the food now.

344
00:24:49,399 --> 00:24:50,423
Now?

345
00:24:50,601 --> 00:24:54,332
Well, the thing is, I can't...

346
00:24:54,505 --> 00:24:57,565
...wait to show you
this hilarious Internet video.

347
00:24:58,675 --> 00:24:59,699
What?

348
00:24:59,877 --> 00:25:01,105
Fight the power!

349
00:25:01,278 --> 00:25:03,246
What is this?

350
00:25:07,718 --> 00:25:09,015
It's so cute.

351
00:25:09,186 --> 00:25:11,017
Pushing. Folding. Connecting.

352
00:25:11,188 --> 00:25:13,986
Taping. Turning.
Painting. Switching.

353
00:25:14,158 --> 00:25:15,284
Staring.

354
00:25:15,459 --> 00:25:16,824
Motivating.

355
00:25:16,994 --> 00:25:19,519
- Placing button.
- I can't believe I've been watching this...

356
00:25:19,696 --> 00:25:21,755
...for three hours.
- I know.

357
00:25:31,008 --> 00:25:32,202
It's working.

358
00:25:32,376 --> 00:25:34,367
What do you guys want for breakfast?

359
00:25:34,545 --> 00:25:36,536
- Gummi Bears.
- Whoa, Steve, no.

360
00:25:36,713 --> 00:25:38,874
We both know how you get
around Gummi Bears.

361
00:25:39,049 --> 00:25:40,448
How about...

362
00:25:40,617 --> 00:25:42,175
...eggs.
- And toast.

363
00:25:42,352 --> 00:25:43,649
Orange juice.

364
00:25:43,821 --> 00:25:45,516
- And bacon.
- Bacon.

365
00:25:46,523 --> 00:25:47,854
What are you doing?

366
00:25:48,025 --> 00:25:49,458
Nothing.

367
00:25:49,626 --> 00:25:50,650
To the computer.

368
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:58,033
So you're sure this is safe?

369
00:25:58,569 --> 00:26:01,060
Don't worry. I have a Dangeometer
that lets us know...

370
00:26:01,238 --> 00:26:03,001
...if the food is going
to over-mutate.

371
00:26:03,173 --> 00:26:05,073
What happens
if the food over-mutates?

372
00:26:05,242 --> 00:26:07,642
I don't know.
But that'll never happen.

373
00:26:07,811 --> 00:26:10,177
All right, this probably
won't explode.

374
00:26:10,347 --> 00:26:11,371
What?

375
00:26:18,088 --> 00:26:19,749
Bacon.

376
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:28,423
Those cheeseburgers
were only the beginning...

377
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:31,363
...because a breakfast system
is on its way to Swallow Falls.

378
00:26:31,535 --> 00:26:32,729
My forecast?

379
00:26:32,903 --> 00:26:34,837
Sunny side up.

380
00:26:42,212 --> 00:26:44,680
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

381
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:56,591
Flint, my boy. Can you do lunch?

382
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,091
All right, here's the skinny:

383
00:26:58,262 --> 00:27:01,129
You keep making it rain
the snackadoos...

384
00:27:01,298 --> 00:27:03,266
...weathergirl provides
free advertising...

385
00:27:03,433 --> 00:27:05,628
...I have taken out
a very high-interest loan...

386
00:27:05,802 --> 00:27:08,862
...to convert this Podunk town
into a tourist food-topia.

387
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:12,440
All you have to do is make it rain food
three meals a day...

388
00:27:12,609 --> 00:27:14,577
...every day
for the foreseeable future...

389
00:27:14,745 --> 00:27:17,509
...and in 30 days we hold a grand
reopening of the island...

390
00:27:17,681 --> 00:27:20,479
...as a must-see cruise destination.

391
00:27:20,651 --> 00:27:23,279
And everyone, everywhere...

392
00:27:23,453 --> 00:27:27,787
...is going to love your invention.

393
00:27:28,158 --> 00:27:29,455
Do you think so?

394
00:27:29,626 --> 00:27:32,060
I know so.

395
00:27:36,433 --> 00:27:39,425
Now that's what I call
poultry in motion.

396
00:27:49,346 --> 00:27:51,906
Mr. Lockwood,
may I please have waffles?

397
00:27:52,082 --> 00:27:53,413
- Falafels?
- Jellybeans.

398
00:27:53,583 --> 00:27:54,948
- Avocado.
- Coming right up.

399
00:27:57,821 --> 00:27:59,015
Leftovers?

400
00:27:59,189 --> 00:28:02,556
Not a problem with Flint Lockwood's
latest invention, the Outtasighter...

401
00:28:02,726 --> 00:28:05,627
...so-named because it catapults
uneaten food out of sight...

402
00:28:05,796 --> 00:28:08,287
...and therefore, out of mind.

403
00:28:16,974 --> 00:28:18,669
Jellybeans!

404
00:28:18,842 --> 00:28:19,866
Awesome.

405
00:28:20,043 --> 00:28:22,341
- BLT.
- Doughnuts.

406
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:24,545
Pie.

407
00:28:24,715 --> 00:28:25,739
Gummi bears.

408
00:28:25,949 --> 00:28:28,213
- Fish.
- Crème brûlée!

409
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,554
A pizza stuffed inside a turkey...

410
00:28:32,723 --> 00:28:35,521
...the whole thing deep-fried
and dipped in chocolate.

411
00:28:36,226 --> 00:28:38,091
It's me, the mayor.

412
00:28:38,695 --> 00:28:40,060
You look different.

413
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:41,993
Did you get a new haircut?

414
00:28:42,165 --> 00:28:44,190
Yes, I did. Thank you for noticing.

415
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:54,800
- I love you. - Thanks, Dad. I love you.
- I love you. - Thanks, Dad. I love you.

416
00:28:54,978 --> 00:28:56,741
I love spending time with you, Dad.

417
00:29:01,018 --> 00:29:03,646
Hey, Dad, I'm headed back
to the lab.

418
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:07,654
If you wanna come,
I could show you how I make the food.

419
00:29:08,158 --> 00:29:09,648
No, thanks.

420
00:29:09,826 --> 00:29:14,957
That techno-food, it's too complicated
for an old fisherman.

421
00:29:15,132 --> 00:29:16,997
Got it.

422
00:29:17,934 --> 00:29:21,335
Could still use your help around here,
though, you know.

423
00:29:21,505 --> 00:29:24,167
I'm working
with the mayor now, Dad.

424
00:29:24,341 --> 00:29:27,504
I mean, the town's grand reopening
is in, like, a week.

425
00:29:27,677 --> 00:29:29,941
Right. Got it.

426
00:29:36,653 --> 00:29:38,985
Flint Lockwood?

427
00:29:39,623 --> 00:29:41,250
Yeah?

428
00:29:42,726 --> 00:29:44,990
It's my son Cal's birthday
tomorrow...

429
00:29:45,162 --> 00:29:48,563
...and I was just wondering if you
could make it rain something special.

430
00:29:48,732 --> 00:29:51,132
Well, I'm pretty backed up
on requests.

431
00:29:51,301 --> 00:29:52,962
Plus, you're always mean to me.

432
00:29:53,136 --> 00:29:54,967
It'll be just one time...

433
00:29:55,138 --> 00:29:57,606
...for my special angel's special day.

434
00:29:58,875 --> 00:30:00,240
I don't know.

435
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:03,709
You know, I don't wanna
overwork the machine, so...

436
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:07,372
Okay. I knew it was a long shot.

437
00:30:07,551 --> 00:30:10,281
I just wanted Cal to see how much
his father loves him.

438
00:30:10,454 --> 00:30:12,217
I thought you would understand.

439
00:30:15,192 --> 00:30:17,387
You know how fathers always trying
to express...

440
00:30:17,561 --> 00:30:21,224
...their love and appreciation
for their sons.

441
00:30:25,068 --> 00:30:26,126
Earl, wait.

442
00:30:37,614 --> 00:30:39,775
Touch. Touch. Touch.

443
00:30:41,918 --> 00:30:43,146
I've got an idea.

444
00:31:01,238 --> 00:31:03,138
Happy birthday, son.

445
00:31:03,306 --> 00:31:04,466
Dad?

446
00:31:04,641 --> 00:31:06,973
This is your day. Go have fun.

447
00:31:07,144 --> 00:31:10,705
- I love you guys. You're awesome.
- I love you too, son.

448
00:31:10,881 --> 00:31:14,476
- Have a good time, baby.
- Ice cream!

449
00:31:15,352 --> 00:31:18,446
Yeah! Cool.

450
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:22,785
Strawberry's my favourite.

451
00:31:35,038 --> 00:31:36,062
Come on, Dad.

452
00:31:36,239 --> 00:31:37,729
I don't know, Cal.

453
00:31:37,908 --> 00:31:40,274
This doesn't look safe!

454
00:31:48,185 --> 00:31:49,311
I love you, son.

455
00:31:49,486 --> 00:31:52,649
I know, Dad. You tell me every day.

456
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,523
Flint, this is amazing.

457
00:31:58,695 --> 00:32:01,289
And designing the ice cream
to accumulate into scoops...

458
00:32:01,464 --> 00:32:03,364
...I don't know how
you're gonna top this.

459
00:32:03,533 --> 00:32:06,400
Maybe with hot fudge.

460
00:32:08,572 --> 00:32:09,664
Hey, Flint.

461
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:11,864
You wanna be in a snowball fight
with us?

462
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:15,002
Flint, what's the problem?

463
00:32:15,178 --> 00:32:17,373
I've never actually been
in a snowball fight.

464
00:32:17,547 --> 00:32:19,777
- Really?
- I don't even know the rules.

465
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:23,579
Is there like a point system or is it...

466
00:32:23,753 --> 00:32:25,618
...to the death?
- No-

467
00:32:25,789 --> 00:32:30,817
You've nev-? I mean, look, even
Steve is throwing chocolate snowballs.

468
00:32:35,532 --> 00:32:38,968
So like this?

469
00:32:39,502 --> 00:32:41,697
No, harder than that.

470
00:32:44,107 --> 00:32:46,701
Snowball.
Snowball, snowball, snowball.

471
00:32:47,711 --> 00:32:50,202
Snowball. Snowball.

472
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:53,372
Well, something to be said
for enthusiasm.

473
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:55,542
Snowball!

474
00:32:56,052 --> 00:32:57,644
Snowball!

475
00:33:00,857 --> 00:33:02,757
Snowball and snowball.

476
00:33:02,926 --> 00:33:03,984
Kids? What's going on?

477
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,253
Snowball.

478
00:33:07,497 --> 00:33:09,328
- Snowball.
- Snowball. Snowball.

479
00:33:09,499 --> 00:33:10,830
I scream, you scream...

480
00:33:11,001 --> 00:33:15,301
...we all scream for Flint Lockwood's
latest tasty town-wide treat...

481
00:33:15,472 --> 00:33:18,532
...with flurries of frozen fun
on what the mayor declared to be...

482
00:33:18,708 --> 00:33:20,141
...an ice cream snow day.

483
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:23,837
He'd also like to invite everyone
in the world to catch a cruise liner...

484
00:33:24,014 --> 00:33:25,641
...and come on down
this Saturday...

485
00:33:25,815 --> 00:33:28,306
...for the grand opening
of Chew And Swallow...

486
00:33:28,485 --> 00:33:31,648
...a town that is truly à la mode.

487
00:33:39,362 --> 00:33:42,422
A town that is truly
topped with ice cream.

488
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:45,534
With today's scoop
for the Weather News Network...

489
00:33:45,702 --> 00:33:48,068
...I'm Sam Sparks.

490
00:33:48,238 --> 00:33:51,969
Flint, this is the best breakfast ever.

491
00:33:58,515 --> 00:33:59,539
That's it!

492
00:33:59,716 --> 00:34:01,445
Researching. Role-playing.

493
00:34:01,618 --> 00:34:03,017
Dialing.

494
00:34:03,186 --> 00:34:04,813
Waiting.

495
00:34:07,057 --> 00:34:08,957
- Sam Sparks.
- Hanging up.

496
00:34:09,125 --> 00:34:11,355
Regretting. Re-psyching.

497
00:34:11,528 --> 00:34:13,393
Saying what I'm doing.

498
00:34:13,563 --> 00:34:15,588
- Flint?
- "Hi, Sam, how are you? That's nice.

499
00:34:15,765 --> 00:34:18,029
I was wondering if you would like
to go on a da-"

500
00:34:18,201 --> 00:34:19,532
Activity with me tomorrow.

501
00:34:21,604 --> 00:34:24,038
- Okay.
- Great, bye. Meet me in the forest.

502
00:34:24,207 --> 00:34:26,641
Nailed it. Gotta go, Steve.

503
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:29,870
Keep an eye on the lab for me.

504
00:34:31,414 --> 00:34:33,780
Steve.

505
00:34:34,217 --> 00:34:35,912
Foster still at the plate.

506
00:34:36,086 --> 00:34:38,020
And nobody out.

507
00:34:38,188 --> 00:34:39,655
Where are we going?

508
00:34:39,823 --> 00:34:42,053
Oh, nowhere.
I just thought it'd be nice...

509
00:34:42,225 --> 00:34:46,286
...for the two of us
to go on a walk together.

510
00:34:46,463 --> 00:34:49,489
Like you do as friends.

511
00:34:49,933 --> 00:34:52,993
Oh, my, what's that?

512
00:35:02,078 --> 00:35:03,739
Jell-O's my favourite.

513
00:35:04,414 --> 00:35:06,712
You never made a request, so...

514
00:35:06,883 --> 00:35:08,714
...I made one for you.

515
00:35:11,554 --> 00:35:13,385
Flint?

516
00:35:13,556 --> 00:35:14,921
Flint?

517
00:35:15,325 --> 00:35:16,952
Join me.

518
00:35:30,673 --> 00:35:31,799
But how did you-?

519
00:35:31,975 --> 00:35:35,172
I made it rain Jell-O, then I gathered
it up with the Outtasighter...

520
00:35:35,345 --> 00:35:37,472
...and then I brought it here
and pressed it...

521
00:35:37,647 --> 00:35:41,208
...into a gigantic custom-carved plastic
Tupperware mold I made. No big deal.

522
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:45,417
Everything's made of Jell-O.

523
00:35:45,588 --> 00:35:47,078
This piano, those sconces...

524
00:35:47,257 --> 00:35:49,725
...that ghetto blaster, that Jell-O,
that aquarium...

525
00:35:49,893 --> 00:35:51,986
...that Venus de Milo
with your face on it...

526
00:35:52,162 --> 00:35:55,097
...next to a Michelangelo's David
that also has your face.

527
00:35:55,899 --> 00:35:59,096
Come on, Sam,
what are you waiting for?

528
00:36:01,271 --> 00:36:02,568
Nothing!

529
00:36:05,308 --> 00:36:06,332
Yeah.

530
00:36:19,355 --> 00:36:21,084
Cannonball.

531
00:36:22,492 --> 00:36:23,959
Belly flop.

532
00:36:27,597 --> 00:36:29,588
Why did I do that?

533
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:40,074
- So Jell-O.
- Right. Right, right.

534
00:36:40,243 --> 00:36:41,710
It's a solid, it's a liquid...

535
00:36:41,878 --> 00:36:46,372
...it's a visco-elastic polymer made of
polypeptide chains, but you eat it.

536
00:36:46,549 --> 00:36:48,210
I mean...

537
00:36:48,384 --> 00:36:50,443
...it tastes good.

538
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:52,554
- Why do you do that?
- Do what?

539
00:36:52,722 --> 00:36:56,852
Say something super smart
and then bail from it.

540
00:36:58,595 --> 00:36:59,653
Can you keep a secret?

541
00:36:59,829 --> 00:37:01,592
No.

542
00:37:02,565 --> 00:37:05,056
But this time, sure, yeah.

543
00:37:06,202 --> 00:37:12,163
Okay. Well, it was a really
long time ago, but I, too, was...

544
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:15,068
...a nerd.

545
00:37:15,678 --> 00:37:16,702
Too?

546
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,246
When I was a little girl...

547
00:37:19,415 --> 00:37:22,009
...I wore a ponytail, I had glasses...

548
00:37:22,185 --> 00:37:25,882
...and I was totally obsessed
with the science of weather.

549
00:37:28,291 --> 00:37:30,282
Other girls wanted a Barbie.

550
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:34,328
I wanted a Doppler Weather
Radar 2000 Turbo.

551
00:37:34,497 --> 00:37:37,466
But all the kids used to taunt me
with this lame song.

552
00:37:37,634 --> 00:37:38,658
It wasn't even clever.

553
00:37:38,835 --> 00:37:40,769
Four-eyes, four-eyes

554
00:37:40,937 --> 00:37:42,996
You need glasses to see

555
00:37:45,909 --> 00:37:47,399
Go on.

556
00:37:48,244 --> 00:37:49,609
So I got a new look...

557
00:37:49,779 --> 00:37:52,270
...gave up the science-y
smart stuff...

558
00:37:52,448 --> 00:37:54,575
...and I was never
made fun of again.

559
00:37:54,751 --> 00:37:58,778
And I still need these glasses,
but I never wear them.

560
00:37:58,955 --> 00:38:01,446
- I'll bet you look great with glasses on.
- I'm not-

561
00:38:01,624 --> 00:38:03,114
And on they go.

562
00:38:07,096 --> 00:38:08,120
- What?
- Nothing.

563
00:38:08,298 --> 00:38:09,788
Wait.

564
00:38:13,836 --> 00:38:16,134
It's a Jell-O scrunchie.

565
00:38:19,175 --> 00:38:22,008
And now, the reveal.

566
00:38:25,515 --> 00:38:26,539
Wow.

567
00:38:27,784 --> 00:38:30,412
I mean, you were okay before...

568
00:38:30,587 --> 00:38:32,487
...but now...

569
00:38:32,956 --> 00:38:35,117
...you're beautiful.

570
00:38:35,291 --> 00:38:37,987
No, I'm not. I can't go out in public
like this.

571
00:38:38,161 --> 00:38:40,994
Well, why not?

572
00:38:41,164 --> 00:38:44,224
I mean, this is the real you, right?

573
00:38:45,702 --> 00:38:47,260
Smart.

574
00:38:47,437 --> 00:38:49,405
Bespectacled.

575
00:38:50,006 --> 00:38:51,974
Who wouldn't wanna see that?

576
00:38:52,141 --> 00:38:56,737
You know, I've never met anyone
like you, Flint Lockwood.

577
00:38:56,913 --> 00:38:58,676
Me either.

578
00:38:58,848 --> 00:39:00,975
But about you.

579
00:39:17,967 --> 00:39:19,696
Flint, you have a call

580
00:39:19,869 --> 00:39:21,769
Flint, you have a call

581
00:39:21,938 --> 00:39:23,701
Is your phone ringing?

582
00:39:23,873 --> 00:39:26,899
That's weird.
Someone must've changed my ring.

583
00:39:27,076 --> 00:39:29,203
Oh, it's the mayor.
Do you mind if I take this?

584
00:39:29,379 --> 00:39:30,403
No, no, no.

585
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:33,344
- Go ahead, take it. That's fine.
- I'm sorry. It's important.

586
00:39:33,516 --> 00:39:36,917
- I should be going too. It's getting late.
- I'm just gonna step outside.

587
00:39:47,296 --> 00:39:49,423
Dad, you came.
I have so much to tell you.

588
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:52,625
- Do I look all right?
- You look great. Come on, let's go.

589
00:39:54,003 --> 00:39:55,300
Dad, I almost kissed a girl.

590
00:39:55,471 --> 00:39:58,167
- It's Baby Brent, you know?
- It was the coolest thing- Hi.

591
00:39:59,008 --> 00:40:01,841
- I should be on the list.
- Hey, Brian.

592
00:40:02,011 --> 00:40:07,142
What? You're letting that guy in?
That guy's a nerd.

593
00:40:09,218 --> 00:40:11,049
Hey, how's it going?

594
00:40:11,688 --> 00:40:14,122
Oh, thank you. Thank you so much.
Thank you.

595
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:17,589
A toast.
To Flint and his delicious steaks.

596
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,695
- Oh, thanks. Thank you.
- Very nice place.

597
00:40:20,863 --> 00:40:22,763
Oh, wow. Thank you.

598
00:40:22,932 --> 00:40:25,833
- Flint Lockwood.
- Earl.

599
00:40:31,274 --> 00:40:32,605
So no roof.

600
00:40:32,775 --> 00:40:35,073
Yep. You just hold out your plate.

601
00:40:35,244 --> 00:40:37,235
And I even made it rain
your favourite:

602
00:40:37,413 --> 00:40:38,437
Meat.

603
00:40:45,855 --> 00:40:46,879
Okay.

604
00:40:47,557 --> 00:40:51,015
So you know how the grand reopening
of the town is tomorrow?

605
00:40:51,194 --> 00:40:56,427
Well, the mayor has asked me
to cut the ribbon.

606
00:40:56,599 --> 00:40:58,965
He said my invention
saved the town.

607
00:40:59,402 --> 00:41:01,734
Aren't you proud of me?

608
00:41:09,712 --> 00:41:11,339
Well...

609
00:41:12,115 --> 00:41:14,413
...doesn't this steak look
a little big to you?

610
00:41:16,519 --> 00:41:21,752
Yeah, it's a big steak. I mean, every
steak is not exactly the same size.

611
00:41:21,924 --> 00:41:24,415
Did you even hear what I just said?

612
00:41:25,795 --> 00:41:27,626
Son, look around.

613
00:41:27,797 --> 00:41:30,322
I'm not sure this is good for people.

614
00:41:31,901 --> 00:41:34,301
Maybe you should think about
turning this thing off.

615
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:37,234
It's making everybody happy.

616
00:41:37,473 --> 00:41:39,338
Everybody except you.

617
00:41:40,009 --> 00:41:42,273
When are you gonna accept
that this is who I am...

618
00:41:42,445 --> 00:41:46,541
...instead of trying to get me to work
in some boring tackle shop?

619
00:41:48,151 --> 00:41:49,743
Well...

620
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:52,787
...you seem like you know
what you're doing, then.

621
00:41:54,757 --> 00:41:57,351
I guess I'll just get out of your way.

622
00:42:25,421 --> 00:42:26,649
Get with the times, man.

623
00:42:26,823 --> 00:42:29,485
I mean, there's no pleasing
that guy.

624
00:42:29,659 --> 00:42:33,755
He just wants to take anything good
I do and just smoosh it.

625
00:42:43,539 --> 00:42:45,973
These are big hot dogs.

626
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:57,843
Man.

627
00:42:58,454 --> 00:43:00,888
I mean, this isn't that bad.

628
00:43:01,057 --> 00:43:02,854
- Is it, Steve?
- Yellow.

629
00:43:03,025 --> 00:43:04,151
You're right, Steve.

630
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:07,126
The Dangeometer is in the yellow.

631
00:43:07,296 --> 00:43:08,661
I don't know what to do.

632
00:43:08,831 --> 00:43:10,423
I do...

633
00:43:11,167 --> 00:43:13,727
...declare these hot dogs
to be delicious!

634
00:43:14,837 --> 00:43:16,498
Oh, no.

635
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,771
How did you get in here?

636
00:43:18,941 --> 00:43:20,772
Tomorrow's the big day, Flint.

637
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:24,711
The entire town's fate is resting
on your food weather.

638
00:43:24,881 --> 00:43:26,007
I'm thinking pasta.

639
00:43:26,449 --> 00:43:30,909
Some light apps.
I know you won't let us down.

640
00:43:33,022 --> 00:43:35,923
Well, Mr. Mayor, I think there's
something you should see.

641
00:43:36,092 --> 00:43:37,354
What?

642
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:41,696
This is the molecular structure
of a hot dog that fell last week.

643
00:43:42,265 --> 00:43:46,725
And this is the molecular structure
of a hot dog that fell today.

644
00:43:47,136 --> 00:43:48,899
The machine uses
microwave radiation...

645
00:43:49,071 --> 00:43:51,301
...to mutate the genetic recipe
of the food.

646
00:43:51,474 --> 00:43:54,136
The more we ask it to make,
the more clouds it takes in...

647
00:43:54,310 --> 00:43:58,303
...the more radiation it emits, the more
these molecules could over-mutate.

648
00:43:59,315 --> 00:44:01,715
I think that's why the food
is getting bigger.

649
00:44:02,752 --> 00:44:04,549
Here's what I heard:

650
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,915
"Science, science, science, bigger."

651
00:44:07,089 --> 00:44:08,750
And bigger is better.

652
00:44:08,925 --> 00:44:12,520
Everyone's gonna love
these new portion sizes.

653
00:44:13,562 --> 00:44:14,927
I know I do.

654
00:44:17,767 --> 00:44:19,598
My dad thinks I should turn it off.

655
00:44:19,769 --> 00:44:24,001
Geniuses like us are never understood
by their fathers, Flint.

656
00:44:24,173 --> 00:44:25,265
But what if things go-

657
00:44:25,441 --> 00:44:27,671
Who needs the approval
of one family member...

658
00:44:27,843 --> 00:44:30,710
...when you can have it
from millions of acquaintances?

659
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:34,407
Not to mention that little cutlet,
Sam Sparks.

660
00:44:34,583 --> 00:44:36,141
And me.

661
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:40,380
I've always felt that you were
like a son to me, Flint.

662
00:44:40,556 --> 00:44:45,516
And I'm gonna be so proud of you
tomorrow when you cut that ribbon...

663
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:47,185
...save the town...

664
00:44:47,363 --> 00:44:51,959
...and prove to everybody
what a great inventor you are.

665
00:44:52,134 --> 00:44:54,659
So here's the cheese:

666
00:44:54,837 --> 00:44:56,805
You can keep it going...

667
00:44:56,973 --> 00:44:58,941
...get everything
you've ever wanted...

668
00:44:59,108 --> 00:45:02,407
...and be the great man
I know you can be.

669
00:45:02,578 --> 00:45:05,342
Or you can turn it off...

670
00:45:05,514 --> 00:45:07,277
...ruin everything...

671
00:45:07,450 --> 00:45:11,113
...and no one will ever like you.

672
00:45:11,787 --> 00:45:13,618
It's your choice.

673
00:45:13,789 --> 00:45:15,086
Choice.

674
00:45:15,257 --> 00:45:16,690
Choice.

675
00:45:16,859 --> 00:45:17,883
Choice.

676
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:19,357
Choice.

677
00:45:19,528 --> 00:45:21,428
Choice.

678
00:45:24,166 --> 00:45:25,190
Okay.

679
00:45:36,379 --> 00:45:39,075
I mean, bigger is better...

680
00:45:39,248 --> 00:45:40,272
...right?

681
00:45:40,449 --> 00:45:42,542
Oh, yeah.

682
00:45:46,455 --> 00:45:50,255
Spaghetti. Asparagus. Celery.
Garlic bread. Meatball. Shrimp.

683
00:46:03,672 --> 00:46:05,970
- Looks safe to me.
- And sanitary too.

684
00:46:39,708 --> 00:46:42,871
Who's hungry?

685
00:46:43,045 --> 00:46:47,607
Welcome, tourists,
to Chew And Swallow.

686
00:46:47,783 --> 00:46:49,307
That is one big mayor.

687
00:46:49,485 --> 00:46:52,943
Delight in our nacho-cheese
hot springs.

688
00:46:54,156 --> 00:46:57,182
Allow your kids to eat
all the junk food they want...

689
00:46:57,359 --> 00:47:00,089
...in our completely
unsupervised Kid Zone!

690
00:47:00,262 --> 00:47:02,287
I've got jellybeans for teeth.

691
00:47:02,465 --> 00:47:04,330
And when the fun is done...

692
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:08,436
...gaze upon the sunset
cresting over Mount Leftovers.

693
00:47:08,604 --> 00:47:12,404
From which we're protected
by a presumably indestructible dam.

694
00:47:12,842 --> 00:47:16,642
We've got people here today
from all around the world...

695
00:47:16,812 --> 00:47:19,042
...from as far as China
to West Virginia.

696
00:47:19,215 --> 00:47:21,080
Also I think there's
some Canadians here.

697
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:23,514
- You need to look at this.
- Why aren't you on TV?

698
00:47:23,686 --> 00:47:25,551
You're supposed
to be broadcasting this.

699
00:47:25,721 --> 00:47:28,053
There's a problem.
The food's getting bigger.

700
00:47:28,224 --> 00:47:31,193
I know, it's great. Bigger portion sizes.
Everyone loves it.

701
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:33,692
I'm not sure we're doing
the right thing here.

702
00:47:33,863 --> 00:47:36,263
What if we've bitten off more
than we can chew?

703
00:47:36,432 --> 00:47:40,368
For the first time in my life, everybody
loves something that I've done.

704
00:47:40,536 --> 00:47:42,731
Why can't you just be
happy for me...

705
00:47:42,905 --> 00:47:45,430
...and go say the weather
or something. Jeez.

706
00:47:45,608 --> 00:47:46,973
And without further ado...

707
00:47:47,143 --> 00:47:51,079
...our town's hero
and my metaphorical son...

708
00:47:51,247 --> 00:47:53,647
...Flint Lockwood.

709
00:47:53,816 --> 00:47:55,147
Yeah, Flint.

710
00:47:55,317 --> 00:47:57,342
Thank you. Thank you, everyone.

711
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,147
- Sign my shrimp.
- Thank you.

712
00:47:59,321 --> 00:48:01,221
- Yeah. Yeah.
- I love you.

713
00:48:01,724 --> 00:48:03,885
I admire your quirkiness, dude.

714
00:48:04,059 --> 00:48:07,688
Brent, we're gonna need you
to hand over the ceremonial scissors.

715
00:48:08,297 --> 00:48:09,764
But-

716
00:48:09,999 --> 00:48:11,023
No.

717
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:14,328
- You can't. You can't take them. No.
- Here you go.

718
00:48:15,070 --> 00:48:17,402
I'm Baby Brent.

719
00:48:19,475 --> 00:48:22,273
Put your clothes back on.

720
00:48:22,878 --> 00:48:25,244
Who am I?

721
00:48:27,016 --> 00:48:29,143
Go ahead, Flint.

722
00:48:29,318 --> 00:48:31,718
Everybody loves you.

723
00:48:31,887 --> 00:48:34,583
Lockwood! Lockwood! Lockwood!

724
00:48:34,757 --> 00:48:37,692
Lockwood! Lockwood! Lockwood!

725
00:49:10,793 --> 00:49:13,853
Danger. Danger. Danger.

726
00:49:17,533 --> 00:49:20,229
Salt-and-pepper wind?

727
00:49:22,004 --> 00:49:23,562
Oregano.

728
00:49:40,155 --> 00:49:43,215
Sam, wait. No, I can turn it off.

729
00:49:48,564 --> 00:49:50,156
I can turn it off.

730
00:50:03,245 --> 00:50:05,770
All right, kid, it's all gonna be okay.

731
00:50:08,484 --> 00:50:10,475
Oh, no.

732
00:50:12,821 --> 00:50:15,449
- Pardon me.
- Pardon me.

733
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:18,716
- Excuse me.
- No problem.

734
00:50:22,398 --> 00:50:24,025
No.

735
00:50:31,473 --> 00:50:33,805
- Gummi Bears.
- Not now, Steve.

736
00:50:40,282 --> 00:50:43,251
Condiments? Salt? Pepper?

737
00:50:45,654 --> 00:50:47,349
Flint.

738
00:50:51,393 --> 00:50:53,725
This is Sam Sparks,
live from Chew And Swallow...

739
00:50:53,896 --> 00:50:55,363
...where a spaghetti twister-

740
00:50:55,531 --> 00:50:59,729
Sam, hey, we love a good storm
over here, but you look like a nerd.

741
00:50:59,902 --> 00:51:04,134
Patrick, several children are stranded
in the path of this tomato tornado.

742
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:05,964
My tummy hurts.

743
00:51:07,843 --> 00:51:09,140
Cal.

744
00:51:10,412 --> 00:51:13,472
What is that, a scrunchie? I haven't
seen one of those since 1995.

745
00:51:13,649 --> 00:51:17,278
What? We have
an actual weather emergency.

746
00:51:17,453 --> 00:51:19,421
Well, we'll get right back
to that storm...

747
00:51:19,588 --> 00:51:22,352
...and hopefully Sam'll look
a little more appealing.

748
00:51:30,032 --> 00:51:33,593
Steve, we just have to upload the kill
code and then we'll shut down the-

749
00:51:33,769 --> 00:51:34,997
What are you doing here?

750
00:51:35,170 --> 00:51:37,434
I've been ordering dinner
for the last 10 minutes.

751
00:51:37,606 --> 00:51:40,040
- Is something going on?
- I've gotta stop the machine.

752
00:51:40,209 --> 00:51:42,404
Everyone's in danger
because of me.

753
00:51:42,578 --> 00:51:45,445
Oh, it can't be that bad.

754
00:51:45,781 --> 00:51:48,443
- No.
- Well, I'm out of here.

755
00:51:48,617 --> 00:51:51,085
I can still stop the order
with the kill code.

756
00:51:54,089 --> 00:51:56,785
- Sending kill code.
- I'm back.

757
00:51:56,959 --> 00:51:59,018
Got to get the button.

758
00:52:00,629 --> 00:52:01,721
Play. Fun. Fun. Play.

759
00:52:01,897 --> 00:52:06,527
Hey, Flint. It's been nice
to beet you.

760
00:52:07,336 --> 00:52:09,861
That's a radish.

761
00:52:31,493 --> 00:52:35,862
That was the only way
to communicate with the machine.

762
00:52:36,265 --> 00:52:37,994
What exactly did you order?

763
00:52:38,167 --> 00:52:42,160
A Vegas-style all-you-can-eat buffet.

764
00:52:44,239 --> 00:52:47,731
Jellybean. Watermelon.
Marshmallow. Pretzel. Sushi.

765
00:52:47,910 --> 00:52:53,974
Cheeseburger. Pretzel. Egg salad.
Strawberry. Marshmallow.

766
00:52:55,918 --> 00:52:57,112
Strawberry.

767
00:53:02,090 --> 00:53:04,581
- Is everyone okay?
- Yeah.

768
00:53:11,266 --> 00:53:13,427
Help, somebody.

769
00:53:13,735 --> 00:53:15,669
Help me, please.

770
00:53:15,838 --> 00:53:17,601
It's my son.

771
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:19,605
We need a doctor.

772
00:53:19,775 --> 00:53:22,608
Is anyone here a doctor? Anyone?

773
00:53:22,778 --> 00:53:24,678
I am a doctor.

774
00:53:24,847 --> 00:53:25,871
You are?

775
00:53:26,048 --> 00:53:28,710
I was, back in Guatemala.

776
00:53:28,884 --> 00:53:30,818
I came here for a better life.

777
00:53:30,986 --> 00:53:32,180
Pretty great decision, eh?

778
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:38,690
How is he, doc?

779
00:53:40,762 --> 00:53:42,059
He's in a food coma.

780
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:45,123
Too much junk food.

781
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:46,631
I need a celery, stat.

782
00:53:46,802 --> 00:53:48,531
Here you go.

783
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:55,273
- Daddy?
- Oh, Cal. Cal.

784
00:53:55,444 --> 00:53:57,912
I love you, son.

785
00:54:01,483 --> 00:54:03,542
Looks like everything
turned out okay.

786
00:54:03,719 --> 00:54:04,845
Not yet, it hasn't.

787
00:54:05,020 --> 00:54:08,387
That twister was an amuse-bouche
compared to what's on the way.

788
00:54:08,557 --> 00:54:11,082
- What's an amuse-bouche?
- Manny, patch us through.

789
00:54:17,332 --> 00:54:18,492
Go.

790
00:54:18,667 --> 00:54:21,534
Cute report, Nancy.
Hey. Hey. Four-eyes.

791
00:54:21,703 --> 00:54:22,829
Can it, Patrick.

792
00:54:23,005 --> 00:54:26,338
We are about to be in the epicentre
of a perfect food storm.

793
00:54:26,508 --> 00:54:28,669
It's going to spread
across the globe.

794
00:54:29,144 --> 00:54:32,511
I've calculated the Coriolis
acceleration of the storm system.

795
00:54:32,681 --> 00:54:34,740
First, it'll hit New York...

796
00:54:34,917 --> 00:54:36,942
...then Paris...

797
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:40,020
...then the Jiayuguan Pass
in eastern China.

798
00:54:40,188 --> 00:54:45,990
And in four hours the entire northern
hemisphere will be one big potluck.

799
00:55:11,219 --> 00:55:12,686
Flint?

800
00:55:20,896 --> 00:55:22,227
Flint?

801
00:55:22,397 --> 00:55:23,455
Hey, Dad.

802
00:55:24,166 --> 00:55:25,758
What are you doing?

803
00:55:25,934 --> 00:55:28,596
Well, I tried to help everybody...

804
00:55:28,770 --> 00:55:32,729
...but instead I ruined everything.

805
00:55:33,308 --> 00:55:35,333
I'm just a piece of junk.

806
00:55:35,510 --> 00:55:39,446
So I threw myself away.

807
00:55:39,881 --> 00:55:43,282
Along with all these
dumb inventions.

808
00:55:43,452 --> 00:55:45,317
This is junk.

809
00:55:46,054 --> 00:55:48,147
This is junk.

810
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:52,151
This is junk.

811
00:55:53,028 --> 00:55:56,862
Oh, son. Listen, when your boat is,
when it's listing...

812
00:55:57,032 --> 00:55:59,500
...and if it's not running,
you know-

813
00:55:59,668 --> 00:56:01,898
Don't worry, Dad, I get it.

814
00:56:02,070 --> 00:56:04,538
Mom was wrong about me.

815
00:56:05,607 --> 00:56:07,598
I'm not an inventor.

816
00:56:08,744 --> 00:56:11,178
I should've just quit when you said.

817
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:20,253
Well...

818
00:56:21,156 --> 00:56:24,887
...when it rains, you put on a coat.

819
00:56:25,293 --> 00:56:29,923
Dad, you know I don't understand
fishing metaphors-

820
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,024
What?

821
00:56:37,139 --> 00:56:38,197
My coat.

822
00:56:48,717 --> 00:56:53,017
Come on, Steve.
We've got diem to carpe.

823
00:56:59,761 --> 00:57:01,023
Kill code downloading.

824
00:57:03,532 --> 00:57:05,898
Redesigning. Virtualizing.

825
00:57:06,068 --> 00:57:07,660
Cutting.

826
00:57:08,336 --> 00:57:10,827
Welding. Forging.

827
00:57:11,006 --> 00:57:12,906
- Wiring.
- Helping.

828
00:57:13,075 --> 00:57:14,702
Testing.

829
00:57:15,911 --> 00:57:17,845
Yes.

830
00:57:21,283 --> 00:57:23,513
Flying Car 2.

831
00:57:23,685 --> 00:57:26,381
Now with wings.

832
00:57:36,932 --> 00:57:39,958
Hey, I had a weird dream
like this once.

833
00:57:40,402 --> 00:57:42,962
I have a macaroni
on my head.

834
00:57:44,306 --> 00:57:45,830
Run.

835
00:57:51,179 --> 00:57:52,305
No school!

836
00:57:57,385 --> 00:58:01,549
Still nothing, nothing in the bottom of
the third inning.

837
00:58:09,464 --> 00:58:10,658
Everyone.

838
00:58:12,734 --> 00:58:14,759
I want to apologize.

839
00:58:16,238 --> 00:58:18,263
Especially to you, Sam.

840
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:20,567
But I have a plan.

841
00:58:20,742 --> 00:58:23,176
This flash drive contains a kill code.

842
00:58:23,345 --> 00:58:26,678
I will fly up into that food storm,
plug it into the machine...

843
00:58:26,848 --> 00:58:28,782
...and shut it down forever...

844
00:58:28,950 --> 00:58:31,316
...while you guys evacuate
the island, using bread

845
00:58:31,486 --> 00:58:33,283
This is all his fault. Get him.

846
00:58:33,455 --> 00:58:34,479
There he is! Get him!

847
00:58:34,656 --> 00:58:35,680
Get Flint.

848
00:58:35,857 --> 00:58:38,951
Let's rock his car back and forth.

849
00:58:43,832 --> 00:58:45,800
Hey!

850
00:58:46,334 --> 00:58:49,235
This mess we're in
is all our faults.

851
00:58:50,705 --> 00:58:53,572
Me, I didn't even protect
my own son.

852
00:58:53,742 --> 00:58:56,210
Look, I'm as mad at Flint as you are.

853
00:58:56,378 --> 00:59:00,712
In fact, when he gets out of that car,
I'm gonna slap him in the face.

854
00:59:00,882 --> 00:59:04,978
I know Flint Lockwood made the food,
but it was made-to-order.

855
00:59:05,153 --> 00:59:08,020
And now it's time for all of us
to pay the bill.

856
00:59:18,633 --> 00:59:20,464
Thank you, Earl.

857
00:59:21,670 --> 00:59:23,331
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

858
00:59:23,505 --> 00:59:27,498
- Let's go build some boats.
- Yeah.

859
00:59:28,043 --> 00:59:29,840
I'm gonna go build a boat.

860
00:59:31,446 --> 00:59:32,470
I'm coming with you.

861
00:59:33,415 --> 00:59:36,748
You're gonna need someone
to navigate you through that storm.

862
00:59:37,719 --> 00:59:39,152
I can't let you do this alone.

863
00:59:39,321 --> 00:59:42,051
- Oh, Sam, I'm so sorry.
- Are you kidding?

864
00:59:42,224 --> 00:59:44,055
- Well, I just thought that we-
- No.

865
00:59:44,226 --> 00:59:45,250
Okay.

866
00:59:45,427 --> 00:59:48,191
- You are going to need a co-pilot.
- You're a pilot too?

867
00:59:48,630 --> 00:59:51,064
Yes. I am also a particle physicist.

868
00:59:51,233 --> 00:59:53,292
- Really?
- No, that was a joke.

869
00:59:53,468 --> 00:59:54,492
I am also a comedian.

870
00:59:57,005 --> 00:59:59,872
- Let's do this thing.
- I'm coming too.

871
01:00:00,041 --> 01:00:02,134
Brent, that's okay.

872
01:00:02,310 --> 01:00:05,404
No, it's not okay.

873
01:00:05,580 --> 01:00:09,209
I've been coasting on my fame
since I was a baby.

874
01:00:09,384 --> 01:00:12,285
But it was all just an illusion.

875
01:00:12,454 --> 01:00:16,550
Maybe up there
I'll find out who I really am.

876
01:00:17,292 --> 01:00:19,920
The car's pretty full, so...

877
01:00:21,062 --> 01:00:22,495
Yeah.

878
01:00:22,664 --> 01:00:23,790
Brent.

879
01:00:23,965 --> 01:00:25,694
Okay.

880
01:00:38,246 --> 01:00:40,077
Good luck, son.

881
01:00:47,522 --> 01:00:49,922
Steve.

882
01:00:51,293 --> 01:00:52,624
Pea-soup fog.

883
01:00:52,794 --> 01:00:55,354
Manny, hit the wipers.

884
01:00:58,199 --> 01:01:01,635
There's massive gastro-precipitation
accumulated around the machine.

885
01:01:03,004 --> 01:01:04,869
It's almost as if it's...

886
01:01:05,206 --> 01:01:08,505
Inside a giant meatball.

887
01:01:12,614 --> 01:01:14,741
Water goes in the top...

888
01:01:14,916 --> 01:01:18,818
...a food hurricane
comes out the bottom.

889
01:01:19,254 --> 01:01:21,119
Glad I'm wearing a diaper.

890
01:01:37,839 --> 01:01:40,034
Anybody order pizza?

891
01:01:40,475 --> 01:01:42,500
Hold on.

892
01:01:42,677 --> 01:01:44,611
The pizza's chasing us?

893
01:01:44,779 --> 01:01:46,679
Sentient food? That's impossible.

894
01:01:46,848 --> 01:01:49,783
Unless its molecular structure's
mutated into super food!

895
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:53,352
That's been genetically engineered
to protect the FLDSMDFR.

896
01:01:53,521 --> 01:01:55,216
Pizza.

897
01:01:55,390 --> 01:01:57,620
Pizza. Pizza. Pizza.

898
01:02:00,695 --> 01:02:05,029
That was close. I mean, can you
imagine if we lost this kill code?

899
01:02:11,639 --> 01:02:12,901
- Tim's Tackle Shop.
- Dad.

900
01:02:13,074 --> 01:02:14,735
You're okay, great.

901
01:02:14,909 --> 01:02:17,434
I need a favour. The fate of the world
depends on it!

902
01:02:17,612 --> 01:02:19,671
Okay, then, skipper.
What do you need?

903
01:02:19,848 --> 01:02:24,080
Go into my lab, get on my computer
and e-mail a file to my cell phone.

904
01:02:31,659 --> 01:02:32,683
All right.

905
01:02:38,066 --> 01:02:40,057
- Want me to drive?
- Yeah, okay.

906
01:02:52,981 --> 01:02:54,949
You're a lot better than me.

907
01:03:01,089 --> 01:03:02,215
Okay, here's the plan:

908
01:03:02,390 --> 01:03:05,188
Sam and I will enter the meteoroid
through the intake here...

909
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:07,692
...which should lead us straight
to the FLDSMDFR.

910
01:03:07,862 --> 01:03:10,592
Manny, you and Steve stay on the
plane. Don't spray that.

911
01:03:10,765 --> 01:03:13,825
Once my dad e-mails me the kill code,
we'll destroy the machine...

912
01:03:14,002 --> 01:03:16,300
...and rendezvous
at the western blowhole in-

913
01:03:16,471 --> 01:03:18,996
- How long until the world's destroyed?
- Twenty minutes.

914
01:03:19,174 --> 01:03:20,198
Just before then.

915
01:03:20,375 --> 01:03:23,208
What about me, Brent?
What do I do?

916
01:03:23,778 --> 01:03:27,578
You can be president
of the back seat.

917
01:03:29,384 --> 01:03:30,442
Deploy hatch.

918
01:03:30,618 --> 01:03:33,815
Car upside down, go.

919
01:03:35,256 --> 01:03:37,087
Ladies first?

920
01:03:37,559 --> 01:03:39,049
No?

921
01:03:39,227 --> 01:03:40,660
All right.

922
01:03:41,763 --> 01:03:43,890
Wait for me.

923
01:03:44,065 --> 01:03:46,090
Great. Okay, I'm good.

924
01:03:48,436 --> 01:03:52,338
As long as we stay on course,
it should be a straight shot to the-

925
01:03:54,542 --> 01:03:56,271
Yeah!

926
01:03:59,647 --> 01:04:01,672
We're a team.

927
01:04:14,329 --> 01:04:16,797
We've landed here
in some kind of exhaust vent.

928
01:04:16,965 --> 01:04:20,867
If we go this way, the Flamidabager
should be right down this air shaft.

929
01:04:21,035 --> 01:04:22,764
Brent, get out of that pie.

930
01:04:22,937 --> 01:04:24,165
What's that?

931
01:04:37,352 --> 01:04:39,115
Oh, boy.

932
01:04:46,161 --> 01:04:48,493
Welcome, Flint.

933
01:04:57,672 --> 01:04:59,697
That's fry oil.

934
01:05:06,347 --> 01:05:07,780
Flint, you have a call.

935
01:05:07,949 --> 01:05:09,177
Flint, you have a-

936
01:05:09,350 --> 01:05:10,874
Dad. Oh, okay, great.

937
01:05:11,052 --> 01:05:13,816
On the screen there's a file
marked "kill code."

938
01:05:13,988 --> 01:05:16,650
- What-?
- Move that into my e-mail window...

939
01:05:17,625 --> 01:05:19,889
...type in my name, and press send.

940
01:05:22,363 --> 01:05:23,387
- Window?
- Okay, Dad...

941
01:05:23,565 --> 01:05:26,557
...you see the thing that looks like
a little piece of paper?

942
01:05:26,734 --> 01:05:28,224
Use the mouse to drag it.

943
01:05:28,436 --> 01:05:30,404
- Drag it? Drag it.
- Drag it. Drag it.

944
01:05:30,605 --> 01:05:33,096
Right? Okay. Great. Okay, great.

945
01:05:33,274 --> 01:05:34,673
It's not dragging.

946
01:05:34,842 --> 01:05:36,867
Drag it across the desktop.

947
01:05:39,814 --> 01:05:42,942
- That didn't do anything.
- Of course it didn't! You know what?

948
01:05:47,088 --> 01:05:48,112
Go, go, go.

949
01:05:48,289 --> 01:05:50,553
Hoist those sails. Toast that bread.

950
01:05:50,959 --> 01:05:52,756
We are running out of time.

951
01:05:56,431 --> 01:05:58,490
Let's move out. Go, go, go.

952
01:05:58,666 --> 01:06:00,497
We can do it.
Come on, move it, move it.

953
01:06:00,668 --> 01:06:04,001
Good job. That's what I'm talking
about. Everybody head to the docks.

954
01:06:10,945 --> 01:06:12,276
Wait, wait.

955
01:06:12,447 --> 01:06:14,915
I have an important announcement.

956
01:06:16,484 --> 01:06:17,781
See you, suckers.

957
01:06:18,620 --> 01:06:19,985
Bon voyage.

958
01:06:20,855 --> 01:06:23,653
And bon appétit.

959
01:06:31,633 --> 01:06:34,067
- Cal.
- Calvin.

960
01:06:43,544 --> 01:06:45,171
Cal, get back here.

961
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:54,147
- Foodalanche.
- Cal.

962
01:06:54,322 --> 01:06:55,983
I'm not gonna lose you again.

963
01:06:56,157 --> 01:06:57,886
Baby.

964
01:07:02,330 --> 01:07:04,525
Hold on tight, Calvin.

965
01:07:37,198 --> 01:07:41,225
Everybody head south.
We gotta stay ahead of that storm.

966
01:07:44,305 --> 01:07:45,897
- Now what?
- Just click "send."

967
01:07:46,074 --> 01:07:48,508
Flint, the Fliminadifiserser's
right down there!

968
01:07:48,710 --> 01:07:52,009
- Dad, hurry.
- Send. Send.

969
01:07:52,180 --> 01:07:53,545
Oh, wait.

970
01:07:56,751 --> 01:07:58,719
Dad? Dad? Can you hear me?

971
01:07:59,287 --> 01:08:00,948
Dad?

972
01:08:01,489 --> 01:08:02,683
Hey, guys?

973
01:08:07,929 --> 01:08:10,762
Holy crap balls.

974
01:08:11,199 --> 01:08:12,962
Go, go, go.

975
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:21,608
I don't know.
I think they're kind of cute.

976
01:08:21,776 --> 01:08:24,040
I mean, this one just walked
right up to me and-

977
01:08:24,212 --> 01:08:25,736
He's got me!

978
01:08:27,682 --> 01:08:29,343
- They ate Brent.
- They ate Brent.

979
01:08:30,485 --> 01:08:34,421
Dad, I'm surrounded
by man-eating chickens right now.

980
01:08:35,490 --> 01:08:36,787
So if this is goodbye...

981
01:08:38,226 --> 01:08:40,592
...thanks for trying
to set me straight.

982
01:08:41,129 --> 01:08:43,723
Figured it out a little late, I guess.

983
01:08:44,732 --> 01:08:46,324
Okay, bye.

984
01:09:04,519 --> 01:09:06,111
Dad.

985
01:09:07,822 --> 01:09:10,552
Hey, give me that phone back.

986
01:09:28,709 --> 01:09:29,903
Baby Brent?

987
01:09:30,077 --> 01:09:33,103
I'm not Baby Brent anymore.

988
01:09:33,281 --> 01:09:36,079
I'm Chicken Brent.

989
01:09:36,250 --> 01:09:40,186
And I'm finally contributing
to society.

990
01:09:40,354 --> 01:09:42,185
Crotch kick.

991
01:09:48,262 --> 01:09:52,494
Now go, you crazy kids,
and save the world.

992
01:09:52,667 --> 01:09:55,329
You did it, Chicken Brent.
You really did it.

993
01:09:55,503 --> 01:09:57,471
Go, go, go.

994
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:01,631
It should be right down this hole.

995
01:10:04,111 --> 01:10:05,135
That's peanut brittle.

996
01:10:06,948 --> 01:10:10,384
If either one of us touches it,
we'll go into anaphylactic shock.

997
01:10:10,852 --> 01:10:13,286
Actually, I'm not entirely allergic
to peanuts.

998
01:10:13,454 --> 01:10:17,151
I might have just said that
to get you to like me.

999
01:10:17,325 --> 01:10:21,489
So you really thought having allergies
would make you more attractive?

1000
01:10:25,032 --> 01:10:26,897
Mustache.

1001
01:10:27,068 --> 01:10:28,695
Mus-

1002
01:10:37,144 --> 01:10:39,635
- Sesame bagel.
- Hey, taxi.

1003
01:10:39,814 --> 01:10:41,645
- Taxi.
- Taxi.

1004
01:10:41,816 --> 01:10:44,478
I asked for extra mustard.

1005
01:10:50,458 --> 01:10:52,926
I was right.

1006
01:11:02,270 --> 01:11:03,498
Hot tea?

1007
01:11:03,671 --> 01:11:05,696
Did he say hot tea?

1008
01:11:07,008 --> 01:11:10,637
"You are about to be crushed
by a giant corn."

1009
01:11:10,811 --> 01:11:12,472
Run.

1010
01:11:14,615 --> 01:11:17,516
It looks like the food storm
is following an unusual pattern...

1011
01:11:17,685 --> 01:11:20,017
...of hitting the world's
famous landmarks first...

1012
01:11:20,187 --> 01:11:23,315
...and is now spreading
to the rest of the globe.

1013
01:11:24,959 --> 01:11:26,051
What the what?

1014
01:11:26,227 --> 01:11:28,752
Hurry up, guys.

1015
01:11:28,963 --> 01:11:31,761
After I plug my phone into
the FLDSMDFR and destroy it...

1016
01:11:31,933 --> 01:11:35,699
...I'll tug on the liquorice twice
and you'll pull me back up, okay?

1017
01:11:36,103 --> 01:11:37,798
Sounds great.

1018
01:11:48,282 --> 01:11:49,544
Oh, no.

1019
01:11:54,589 --> 01:11:55,954
You got cut, didn't you?

1020
01:11:57,325 --> 01:11:59,088
It's just a scratch.

1021
01:12:00,261 --> 01:12:03,958
Brent, you need to take Sam back to
the plane to get her an allergy shot.

1022
01:12:04,131 --> 01:12:05,291
Just a second.

1023
01:12:05,466 --> 01:12:06,728
What? No.

1024
01:12:07,201 --> 01:12:10,261
- Let go, Sam.
- I'm not gonna let you go.

1025
01:12:10,438 --> 01:12:13,305
Flint, you'll be stuck down there.

1026
01:12:13,474 --> 01:12:15,635
It's not ideal, no.

1027
01:12:16,243 --> 01:12:18,643
Come with us. We'll start over.

1028
01:12:18,813 --> 01:12:22,249
We'll live underground.
Use bacon for clothes.

1029
01:12:22,416 --> 01:12:24,179
Sam, that's not a very good plan.

1030
01:12:24,352 --> 01:12:26,980
It is if it means
I don't have to lose you.

1031
01:12:27,755 --> 01:12:30,087
Look, I like you, okay?

1032
01:12:31,559 --> 01:12:34,289
Like- Like, as a friend?

1033
01:12:34,462 --> 01:12:36,259
No.

1034
01:12:36,464 --> 01:12:39,126
Like, "like you" like you.

1035
01:12:41,836 --> 01:12:43,531
Me too.

1036
01:12:45,206 --> 01:12:47,197
But about you.

1037
01:12:52,613 --> 01:12:53,671
Goodbye, Sam.

1038
01:12:53,848 --> 01:12:56,373
Flint. No.

1039
01:12:56,550 --> 01:12:57,812
Hang on, Sam.

1040
01:12:57,985 --> 01:13:00,886
Dr. Manny's got the medicine
for your face.

1041
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:08,021
Pickles.

1042
01:13:09,497 --> 01:13:10,691
Beets.

1043
01:13:10,865 --> 01:13:13,265
Banana.

1044
01:13:13,434 --> 01:13:16,130
Strawberry.

1045
01:13:27,415 --> 01:13:30,384
- Manny, we're on our way. Hurry.
- Hang on, Sam.

1046
01:13:30,551 --> 01:13:32,917
I'm circling the blowhole.

1047
01:13:36,824 --> 01:13:37,848
Scared.

1048
01:13:49,003 --> 01:13:50,027
Gummi Bears.

1049
01:13:50,204 --> 01:13:52,695
Play with us, play with us.
Eat us, eat us.

1050
01:13:53,841 --> 01:13:55,206
Hungry.

1051
01:13:55,976 --> 01:13:59,173
Hungry. Gummi Bears. Gummi Bears.
Gummi Bears. Steve hungry. Hungry.

1052
01:13:59,346 --> 01:14:01,405
Steve starving. Hungry.
Hungry. Starving.

1053
01:14:08,122 --> 01:14:10,283
Manny. Where are you?

1054
01:14:34,181 --> 01:14:36,308
- She touched a peanut or something.
- Oh, boy.

1055
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:48,118
Corn.

1056
01:15:22,730 --> 01:15:23,754
Grabbing.

1057
01:15:24,298 --> 01:15:26,266
Tying. Throwing.

1058
01:15:29,236 --> 01:15:31,033
Waiting.

1059
01:15:33,107 --> 01:15:34,131
Swinging.

1060
01:15:43,350 --> 01:15:46,217
Sorry, old friend.
The kitchen's closed.

1061
01:15:50,925 --> 01:15:51,949
Fight the power!

1062
01:15:52,359 --> 01:15:53,451
Dad.

1063
01:15:53,627 --> 01:15:54,821
No.

1064
01:16:35,836 --> 01:16:40,205
When it rains, you put on a coat...

1065
01:16:40,374 --> 01:16:42,399
...of Spray-On Shoes.

1066
01:16:44,745 --> 01:16:47,407
Yeah.

1067
01:17:02,263 --> 01:17:04,925
Just- There were chickens-

1068
01:17:05,099 --> 01:17:06,191
Where's Flint?

1069
01:17:09,870 --> 01:17:11,497
No!

1070
01:17:12,139 --> 01:17:13,834
I know, kid.

1071
01:17:14,008 --> 01:17:15,270
I know.

1072
01:17:24,485 --> 01:17:26,749
- Cool.
- Yeah. All right.

1073
01:18:04,525 --> 01:18:05,856
Flint?

1074
01:18:09,029 --> 01:18:10,428
I'm sorry.

1075
01:18:28,849 --> 01:18:31,579
Your son was a great man.

1076
01:18:56,810 --> 01:18:59,574
- Steve.
- Steve.

1077
01:18:59,747 --> 01:19:01,408
- Flint.
- Brent.

1078
01:19:01,582 --> 01:19:03,140
- Flint.
- Cal.

1079
01:19:03,317 --> 01:19:04,409
- Steve.
- Flint.

1080
01:19:04,585 --> 01:19:05,813
- Earl.
- Flint.

1081
01:19:05,986 --> 01:19:08,318
- You guy.
- Steve.

1082
01:19:10,691 --> 01:19:11,919
Sam.

1083
01:19:12,092 --> 01:19:13,252
Flint.

1084
01:19:14,228 --> 01:19:15,320
Sam.

1085
01:19:15,496 --> 01:19:17,191
- Flint.
- Flint.

1086
01:19:17,364 --> 01:19:18,695
- Dad.
- Steve.

1087
01:19:18,866 --> 01:19:20,663
Flint.

1088
01:19:24,505 --> 01:19:28,464
Look, when you-
When you cast your line...

1089
01:19:28,642 --> 01:19:32,442
...if it's not straight-

1090
01:19:33,180 --> 01:19:35,375
Oh, for crying out loud.

1091
01:19:39,219 --> 01:19:41,084
I'm proud of you, Flint.

1092
01:19:41,655 --> 01:19:44,283
I'm amazed that someone
as ordinary as me...

1093
01:19:44,458 --> 01:19:48,519
...could be the father of someone
as extraordinary as you.

1094
01:19:48,695 --> 01:19:51,994
You're talented,
you're a total original.

1095
01:19:52,166 --> 01:19:54,999
And your lab is breathtaking.

1096
01:19:55,169 --> 01:19:58,161
Your mom, she always knew
you were going to be special.

1097
01:19:58,338 --> 01:20:01,432
And if she were alive today,
she'd tell us both:

1098
01:20:01,608 --> 01:20:03,769
"I told you so."

1099
01:20:04,711 --> 01:20:07,805
Now, look,
when I take this thing off...

1100
01:20:07,981 --> 01:20:11,439
...and you hear me
make a fishing metaphor...

1101
01:20:12,219 --> 01:20:15,120
...just know
that fishing metaphor means:

1102
01:20:15,289 --> 01:20:17,120
I love my son.

1103
01:20:17,291 --> 01:20:19,589
I love you too, Dad.

1104
01:20:30,671 --> 01:20:32,536
So where were we?

1105
01:20:32,706 --> 01:20:34,503
You were about to kiss me.

1106
01:20:34,675 --> 01:20:36,700
Were you gonna kiss me back?

1107
01:20:36,877 --> 01:20:38,367
Why don't you find out?

1108
01:20:38,545 --> 01:20:41,446
Because I don't want to go for it and
then get shut down again.

1109
01:20:41,615 --> 01:20:43,378
- Just kiss me.
- You know-

1110
01:20:53,327 --> 01:20:56,524
Yeah. I'm a chicken.

1111
01:21:14,481 --> 01:21:18,281
This was not well thought out.

00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:36,916
Sir loan from AIG Federal Government gets it on 79.9 percent stake. 

2
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:42,583
I'll take that. 

3
00:01:42,708 --> 00:01:45,416
Hello. Ya. Will do. 

4
00:01:45,625 --> 00:01:47,166
AG corporation at 11.8 

5
00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:48,708
Okay, sure. 

6
00:01:48,833 --> 00:01:50,583
I will call you back. 

7
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:51,833
Akash. 

8
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,041
Akash. 

9
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:55,208
There was a call from the bank. Our loan has been sanctioned. 

10
00:01:55,375 --> 00:01:59,041
-
Yes, we're buying Ellen Steel company. 
-What? 

11
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:00,833
Why? 

12
00:02:00,958 --> 00:02:04,875
It's a small loan, for around 1-1.5 million dollars. 

13
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:10,583
Guys, Ellen Steel is a dead company. 

14
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:13,333
We'll make our clients invest their money in it. 

15
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:15,541
Which will increase its stock value. 

16
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,708
And if the stock value increases.. 

17
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:21,041
..so will the profit. 
- No, no, that's not our job. 

18
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:22,125
Taking loans is not what we do.. Akash? 

19
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,541
Chill Dude 

20
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:35,541
Sir, can you spare me some change. 

21
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:53,041
"Is the season to be jolly.." 

22
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:08,750
'I am not responsible for this crash Mr. Lee' 

23
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:10,708
'Sir, please don't raise your voice on me.' 

24
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:13,708
'What happened when you made 150% profit last year? ' 

25
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:17,041
'Fine, I don't need you to do business.' 

26
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:18,291
'I will survive this.' 

27
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:24,333
'Akash.' 

28
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:29,500
'The market has crashed.' 

29
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:33,708
'It's over man. It just moved too fast.' 

30
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:36,958
'There was a call from the bank.' 

31
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:40,750
'Yeah, we'll payback their loan.' 

32
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:42,500
'They aren't going to lose their money.' 

33
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:45,666
'Why did you do this? ' 

34
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:49,750
'Listen, all of you knew that I was taking a loan.' 

35
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:52,416
'That's a Lie.' 

36
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:54,958
'You took our signatures for the loan.. 

37
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:56,791
..telling us that it was for 1 million dollars.' 

38
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:05,791
'And went ahead and took a loan of 12 million.' 

39
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:08,791
'What, 12 million? ' 

40
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:12,583
'Yes.. if that company had done well 

41
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:14,541
'I wasn't going to be the only one to profit from it' 

42
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:17,708
'We're all equal partners.' 

43
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:20,250
'Would you guys have agreed.. 

44
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:21,750
..if I had said it was a loan of 12 million? ' 

45
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,041
'All of you.. ' 

46
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:26,625
'All of you think small.' 

47
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:29,041
You think, it was easy to make this big office? 

48
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:31,291
'I didn't know the market would crash.' 

49
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:33,541
So, you cheated us. 

50
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:38,625
'You were in a hurry to make it big, isn't it? ' 

51
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:41,708
'You wanted to win every race.' 

52
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:46,500
We don't want to come first. 

53
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:50,916
Our dreams aren't as big as yours 

54
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,833
'What do you'll want to do? ' 

55
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:57,041
'Shut down the company.' 

56
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:59,041
'Sell the office! - Akash, please.' 

57
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:00,333
'Try to understand. - not there' 

58
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:01,625
'All of you were losers.' 

59
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,625
'All of you were losers! - Akash, please' 

60
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:06,500
'Go on.. let me see what you'll are capable of without me.' 

61
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:07,750
'Where will we go? ' 

62
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:08,958
'How will we repay the loan? ' 

63
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:10,416
Tell me how will we pay it back? - Gaurav. 

64
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:13,041
Where will we go and how will we repay it? - Gaurav, please. 

65
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:16,541
How will we repay the loan now, tell me 

66
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:18,916
How? 

67
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:25,416
What will we do without you? 

68
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,500
Your mom and dad live without you as well. 

69
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,541
You could neither be a good son, nor a good friend. 

70
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,208
What did you earn? 

71
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:39,833
Money. 

72
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,166
Now you don't even have that. 

73
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:45,666
Forget it. 

74
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:47,333
Forget it. 

75
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:48,708
We're losers. 

76
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:50,291
Yes. 

77
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:57,791
But today.. you're the loser. 

78
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:25,041
And the suicide rate has risen to 27.. 

79
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:27,375
A 48 year old man committed suicide today.. 

80
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,041
..by jumping off his office building. 

81
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:31,833
It seems he was everything. 

82
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:34,250
I am not responsible for this crash. 

83
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:37,041
Market, there's crash. 

84
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:39,458
How did I know that the market would crash? 

85
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:41,208
Die. 

86
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:44,041
Should I push you? 

87
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:48,708
What else? 

88
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,583
You've been standing there for so long. 

89
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:57,875
Actually no. Because that will amount to murder. 

90
00:06:58,541 --> 00:06:59,666
No, no, I don't think so. 

91
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:02,083
Please continue, jump jump. 

92
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:15,166
You know.. when you want to do something like this.. 

93
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:16,666
..you shouldn't think. 

94
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:18,333
Just do it. 

95
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:26,041
Are you a suicide consultant? 

96
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:28,166
Its common sense, man. 

97
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:44,750
When I am slightly drunk.. I talk a lot. 

98
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:47,208
Jabber jabber jabber jabber 

99
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,083
Actually, in real life I am very quiet. 

100
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:52,958
Like really quiet. 

101
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,291
But wait.. this is real life. 

102
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:04,833
Sorry. I am sorry. 

103
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:06,458
Concentrate. 

104
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:10,041
Quiet. 

105
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,708
Continue, jump jump 

106
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:25,458
You know.. when I was really young. 

107
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:27,208
Really young. 

108
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:31,666
I never liked drinking medicine. 

109
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:37,958
My mother would say to me "Close your eyes.." 

110
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:40,875
"..count to three and drink it". 

111
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,125
Just.. 

112
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:47,666
So try that. 

113
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,750
Okay, so I am also done. 

114
00:08:58,416 --> 00:08:59,666
Boy. 

115
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:11,625
One. 

116
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:18,541
Two. 

117
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,833
Three. 

118
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:27,833
Get off the bridge now! 

119
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,041
Oh no! Coast guard. 

120
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,750
Oh no. 

121
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:36,333
God! 

122
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:41,666
Alright, break it up you two, get off the bridge, the party is over. 

123
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:44,041
Get off the bridge now. Come on. 

124
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:03,291
'I'll elope with you on this.' 

125
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:04,583
'I am at the Hilton and the room number.. ' 

126
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:06,333
'Last night I did the same thing..' 

127
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,875
I found out about your accident. 

128
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:40,750
I've come alone 

129
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:45,458
No one else was ready to see you. 

130
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:47,750
Then why are you here? 

131
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:52,166
The loan you.. 

132
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:58,500
The loan we took, has been sorted out with the bank 

133
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:02,291
We are dissolving the company's assets. 

134
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:07,041
We've also found a buyer for the office. 

135
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:13,458
And we'll repay the rest by selling our personal belongings. 

136
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:20,041
The bank has summoned us on the 30th. 

137
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:21,541
Everyone. 

138
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:26,208
Since you are the guarantor.. 

139
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:29,708
..it is important for you to be there, Akash. 

140
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:45,208
Akash, I know that the bank has seized your house. 

141
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:50,541
But even after what has happened.. 

142
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:54,708
..you can still live with us. 

143
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,750
For as long as you want. 

144
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:00,041
Really. 

145
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,583
Please. 

146
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:15,583
Be there on the 30th. 

147
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:20,333
For once, Do something for others. 

148
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:52,916
What are you doing here? - What are you doing here? 

149
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:13,250
Oh God. 

150
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:14,958
Why are you following me? 

151
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,958
I can't help it, you're so attractive you know 

152
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:21,708
What happened to you? 

153
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:25,166
I tried to jump from the bridge after you and the police left.. 

154
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,666
..and fell down. 

155
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:28,416
And that's all that happened to you? 

156
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,916
I fell on the bridge not from the bridge. I was so drunk. 

157
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:38,416
Did you really want to die? - No, I was sightseeing. 

158
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,041
What happened to you? 

159
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:44,708
I tried again as well. 

160
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:46,500
Jumped in front of a car. 

161
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:49,833
And you failed as well. 

162
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:05,958
So.. are you going to try again? 

163
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:08,916
Hmm.. You too? 

164
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:21,541
What are you doing? Just.. 

165
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:28,791
They'll think that we're escaping.. 

166
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:30,791
..from the mental asylum in these clothes. 

167
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:36,500
One more thing. 

168
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,583
I've no interest in you. 

169
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:40,666
Zilch. 

170
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:43,791
Get that straight. 

171
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:50,416
I don't know if I should be relieved.. 

172
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:54,875
..or then begin to wonder why you aren't interested in me? 

173
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:59,333
Not that I want you to be interested in me. 

174
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:00,791
If you know what I mean? 

175
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:03,208
What am I doing with you? 

176
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:09,875
Hey. 

177
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:16,166
These scrubs look so funny from the back, isn't it? 

178
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:20,458
Whatever. 

179
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:26,250
I am Kiara. - Akash. 

180
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:34,750
So.. what is your plan? - Listen, please leave me alone. 

181
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:37,583
You know, you are very rude 

182
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:41,125
But, I am still asking you. 

183
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:46,208
Can we do this together? 

184
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:48,750
This isn't a game of double tennis that we can do together 

185
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:51,041
I'm just saying that because.. 

186
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:53,500
..I want to make sure it happens. 

187
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:58,125
I've been very dependant in life. 

188
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:06,041
I've always needed.. a push. 

189
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:09,916
So please. 

190
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:17,833
Well.. it's strange, but.. fine. 

191
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:21,250
How do you want to do it? 

192
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:25,041
We can go to my house. - What? 

193
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:27,041
I am not inviting you for coffee. 

194
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:30,750
Whatever. 

195
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:32,583
We can go to your house as well. 

196
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:35,625
I don't have a house. 

197
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:47,958
Stop. Stop. Stop. Here. 

198
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:54,500
Come on. - This way? 

199
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:56,333
I never have my house keys. 

200
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,333
After you. - Oh no. 

201
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,541
You're very smart. I know why you want to climb up after me. 

202
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:04,291
Come on, I am cold. - Oh please. 

203
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:11,958
Okay. 

204
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:21,125
Can you push me a little bit? - With pleasure. 

205
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:39,916
Lights on. Music on. 

206
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,208
What the hell. 

207
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,250
I hate this song. 

208
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:52,666
Excuse me. 

209
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,541
What are you doing? 

210
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:57,333
Making place to sit. 

211
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,041
No need to get.. too comfortable. 

212
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:04,333
You're not here to stay. 

213
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:09,958
Let's do what we have to. - What? 

214
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:15,458
I know, I know. 

215
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:17,458
We've ropes. 

216
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:18,958
We can hang ourselves. 

217
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:21,666
These sprinklers won't be able to take your weight. 

218
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:24,041
You know you're.. - Do you have plastic wrap? 

219
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:26,083
What will we do with plastic wrap? - Do you have it? 

220
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:32,041
Okay. Here. 

221
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:37,166
Asphyxiation. - As.. What? 

222
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,041
Suffocation. 

223
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:42,083
It's very effective. 

224
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:45,333
You, first take this and wrap it tightly around my face. 

225
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,666
Then I'll wrap it around your's. 

226
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:50,125
Then, when the oxygen stops reaching our brains, in a few minutes.. 

227
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,208
..it will stop working. 

228
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:56,333
Let's start. - Ya. 

229
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:06,041
Okay. 

230
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,166
Your face is too long. 

231
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:16,791
Can you breathe? 

232
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:18,041
No? 

233
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:19,166
Okay. 

234
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:20,416
Alright. 

235
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:22,291
Now my turn. 

236
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:27,708
Come on. 

237
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:29,250
Alright. 

238
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:31,375
Start already! 

239
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,833
Oh my, God. You cheat. 

240
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:38,875
You knew it.. you knew that you wouldn't be able to help me. 

241
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:40,166
I won't let you die. 

242
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:42,958
You will die and I will be the murderer. 

243
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,666
Is it my fault? 

244
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:46,750
You blindfolded my eyes, how could I see? 

245
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:47,958
Couldn't you tell me before? 

246
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:50,125
If you had died, I would've been jailed. 

247
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,875
This is so not going to work. 

248
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,541
Oh my, God. 

249
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:01,875
I have an idea. 

250
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:11,291
There are just three left. 

251
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,291
Okay. 

252
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:30,583
May I? - Okay. 

253
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:40,833
Paper. - Paper. 

254
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:42,041
Paper. - Paper, quickly. 

255
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:43,208
Paper. Paper. Paper. - Quickly Kiara. 

256
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:44,416
More paper? I'll get it. 

257
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:46,125
More paper. More paper. More paper. More paper. - More paper. 

258
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:50,416
Is the gas on? Is the gas on? 

259
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:51,666
The gas is on. 

260
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,666
Kiara. - Yes. 

261
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,083
When did you last pay your bill? - Which bill? 

262
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:58,041
Your gas bill. 

263
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:01,125
Your gas connection has been cut off for the past 2 months 

264
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:04,041
I have never cooked. 

265
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:05,291
How was I supposed to know? 

266
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:07,708
Look, I don't know if you think this is a joke.. 

267
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:08,958
But for me, it isn't 

268
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:10,125
If you got hold of me 

269
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:12,541
..just to get rid of your loneliness, then go pick someone else up. 

270
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:14,458
Go to any bar, I'm sure you'll find someone there. 

271
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:16,208
But just leave me alone. 

272
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:23,333
Look, I am.. 

273
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:27,500
I am sorry. 

274
00:22:37,125 --> 00:22:39,750
I think I know why this is happening. 

275
00:22:43,333 --> 00:22:44,875
Last night we met on the bridge. 

276
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:46,250
Both of us. 

277
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:48,208
But the coast guard arrived. 

278
00:22:49,041 --> 00:22:53,333
We then tried separately, but failed. 

279
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:57,125
Then we met in the hospital. 

280
00:22:58,166 --> 00:23:03,708
Strangely again.. we decided to commit suicide together. 

281
00:23:04,875 --> 00:23:07,416
We came home. Tried twice. 

282
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,541
But failed again. 

283
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:14,458
So many attempts in one day, but all failed. 

284
00:23:16,916 --> 00:23:18,125
Why? 

285
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:21,833
Do you believe in signs? 

286
00:23:21,916 --> 00:23:23,375
What rubbish is this? 

287
00:23:23,541 --> 00:23:25,041
It's just that you don't want to die. 

288
00:23:25,166 --> 00:23:28,375
I have tried just as hard as you have, Akash. 

289
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:36,500
Maybe you or me have something left to do in life? 

290
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:39,333
'The bank has called us on the 30th.' 

291
00:23:39,666 --> 00:23:42,750
'For the first time.. do something for others.' 

292
00:23:44,666 --> 00:23:45,833
Okay fine. 

293
00:23:45,916 --> 00:23:49,041
Then explain to me why we are still alive. 

294
00:23:49,583 --> 00:23:51,208
'Since you are the guarantor..' 

295
00:23:52,041 --> 00:23:54,750
'.. it is very important for you to be there, Akash.' 

296
00:23:56,708 --> 00:23:57,916
Its rubbish. 

297
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:00,458
Its nonsense, I don't believe in all this. 

298
00:24:00,666 --> 00:24:02,208
Maybe.. maybe you're right. 

299
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:07,625
Let's try again. 

300
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:09,875
Let's try your idea. 

301
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,333
And this time we'll be careful. 

302
00:25:11,666 --> 00:25:13,041
I am telling you, Akash. 

303
00:25:13,791 --> 00:25:15,250
So many signs. 

304
00:25:16,333 --> 00:25:20,500
There has to be a reason.. something.. that is stopping us. 

305
00:25:23,916 --> 00:25:25,625
Should we take some time? 

306
00:25:28,708 --> 00:25:30,875
Two days? Four days? 

307
00:25:34,416 --> 00:25:36,416
What's the date today? 

308
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:41,041
Seventh.. eighth November.. - 11th December. 

309
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:43,166
Yes, right. 11th December. 

310
00:25:47,458 --> 00:25:48,833
Then 31st December. 

311
00:25:50,125 --> 00:25:53,375
Means.. 11, 12, 13, 14.. - 20 days. 

312
00:25:54,708 --> 00:25:56,625
18, 19.. - Its 20 days. 

313
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,083
Right. 

314
00:25:59,208 --> 00:26:00,666
So 31st December. 

315
00:26:04,166 --> 00:26:05,958
New Year's night. 

316
00:26:13,375 --> 00:26:16,791
New Year's night. At 12 o'clock. 

317
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:19,750
We'll jump from that bridge. 

318
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:23,750
Its a pact. 

319
00:26:26,625 --> 00:26:28,500
But what will we do in these 20 days? 

320
00:26:30,416 --> 00:26:32,208
Things to do before you die. 

321
00:26:33,666 --> 00:26:37,333
Everyone boasts of things that they wish to do before they die.. 

322
00:26:37,958 --> 00:26:39,416
But never end up doing them. 

323
00:26:40,791 --> 00:26:41,916
Anything. 

324
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,041
Fun, spontaneous, adventurous. 

325
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,125
Everyone does it to enjoy their life. 

326
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,833
We'll do it to die! 

327
00:26:54,416 --> 00:26:56,708
No, its all nonsense. 

328
00:26:57,291 --> 00:26:58,833
I can't do this. 

329
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:30,416
'Neither could I become someone's son..' 

330
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,916
'..nor could I become somebody's friend.' 

331
00:27:32,041 --> 00:27:34,041
'Akash its over man, it just moved too fast.' 

332
00:27:34,125 --> 00:27:36,166
'You were always in a hurry to make it big, weren't you? ' 

333
00:27:36,291 --> 00:27:37,958
'You wanted to win every race.' 

334
00:27:38,041 --> 00:27:39,208
'Shut down the company.' 

335
00:27:39,333 --> 00:27:40,416
'Sell the office! ' 

336
00:27:40,541 --> 00:27:41,791
'All of you were losers.' 

337
00:27:41,875 --> 00:27:43,041
'All of you were losers! ' 

338
00:27:43,083 --> 00:27:45,041
'Where will we go? How will we repay the loan? ' 

339
00:27:45,208 --> 00:27:48,833
Tell me, how will we pay it back? ' 

340
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:37,750
So I guess, new year's night 

341
00:28:41,708 --> 00:28:42,916
I guess. 

342
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:50,750
"Close your eyes when you don't see your destination." 

343
00:28:52,083 --> 00:28:59,791
"When you close your eyes and seek you find the path to God." 

344
00:29:00,333 --> 00:29:03,083
"Change your own fate." 

345
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:06,250
"Have courage and move ahead." 

346
00:29:06,375 --> 00:29:11,875
"My footprints will show you the way." 

347
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:17,958
"You're unaware that God's all around you." 

348
00:29:18,166 --> 00:29:23,625
"You're unaware that God's all around you." 

349
00:29:23,833 --> 00:29:29,875
"You're unaware that God's all around you." 

350
00:29:30,125 --> 00:29:35,541
"You're unaware that God's all around you." 

351
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,958
"You're unaware that God's all around you." 

352
00:29:42,041 --> 00:29:47,750
"You're unaware that God's all around you." 

353
00:30:09,375 --> 00:30:11,208
You can't report four hours late for work. 

354
00:30:11,333 --> 00:30:12,958
This is completely ridiculous. 

355
00:30:13,041 --> 00:30:14,833
You can't just walk-in whenever you feel like. 

356
00:30:14,958 --> 00:30:17,041
You know what, you are fired. 

357
00:30:19,041 --> 00:30:21,833
"Take a look at yourself." 

358
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,458
"Why did you give-in to the situation and give up." 

359
00:30:25,541 --> 00:30:28,041
I was going to quit anyway. 

360
00:30:28,125 --> 00:30:35,750
"Your courage can change your destiny." 

361
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:41,666
"Fill your world with the colour of your dreams." 

362
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:45,208
"I am always with you." 

363
00:30:45,375 --> 00:30:48,250
"So what if the sun's setting." 

364
00:30:48,458 --> 00:30:54,125
"You'll find my threshold when the darkness sets in." 

365
00:30:54,333 --> 00:30:58,916
"And that is where you'll find new hope once again.' 

366
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,875
"You're unaware that God's all around you." 

367
00:31:06,041 --> 00:31:11,833
"You're unaware that God's all around you." 

368
00:31:11,916 --> 00:31:17,875
"You're unaware that God's all around you." 

369
00:31:17,958 --> 00:31:23,541
"You're unaware that God's all around you." 

370
00:31:23,916 --> 00:31:28,791
"You're unaware that God's all around you." 

371
00:31:30,208 --> 00:31:35,791
"You're unaware that God's all around you." 

372
00:31:43,166 --> 00:31:44,625
But why me first? 

373
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:46,958
Because knowing you.. 

374
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,166
..you must have a strange, complicated wish. 

375
00:31:51,041 --> 00:31:52,958
Or you might not have a wish at all. 

376
00:31:53,416 --> 00:31:55,291
No, no, of course I do. 

377
00:31:55,416 --> 00:31:57,125
Really? Then tell me. 

378
00:32:01,083 --> 00:32:02,125
Take your time. 

379
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:03,666
There's no hurry. 

380
00:32:10,375 --> 00:32:13,000
"If wishes were horses." 

381
00:32:13,083 --> 00:32:15,375
"Beggars would ride" 

382
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:19,250
"If the stars fell down from heaven.." 

383
00:32:19,333 --> 00:32:23,875
"..I would make my wish now and tonight." 

384
00:32:25,625 --> 00:32:27,041
Come on. 

385
00:32:27,333 --> 00:32:29,500
Have you done everything? 

386
00:32:29,833 --> 00:32:31,625
Isn't there anything that you wanted to do.. 

387
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,125
..but didn't get the chance to.. 

388
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:34,541
..or left it for later 

389
00:32:34,625 --> 00:32:37,375
I mean.. there's got to be something. 

390
00:32:42,375 --> 00:32:45,291
There's one thing actually. - Finally? 

391
00:32:46,208 --> 00:32:47,541
Tell me. 

392
00:32:50,541 --> 00:32:57,416
Can I.. get a beer? 

393
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:59,208
And that's your wish? 

394
00:33:00,125 --> 00:33:04,583
I need the beer so that.. I can tell you what my wish is? 

395
00:33:06,916 --> 00:33:08,041
That's nice. 

396
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,291
This seems like it's going to be a really good wish. 

397
00:33:12,541 --> 00:33:13,916
Here. 

398
00:33:23,583 --> 00:33:28,416
So.. I thought I'll wait. 

399
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:33,583
You know for.. for the right girl. 

400
00:33:35,625 --> 00:33:36,875
Kiara! 

401
00:33:38,125 --> 00:33:39,375
What? - You were sleeping. 

402
00:33:39,458 --> 00:33:41,708
No. No, I wasn't sleeping at all. 

403
00:33:41,833 --> 00:33:42,916
How could I sleep.. 

404
00:33:43,041 --> 00:33:44,666
When I was listening very carefully.. 

405
00:33:44,791 --> 00:33:46,458
To everything that you didn't say. 

406
00:33:46,583 --> 00:33:47,666
Seriously. 

407
00:33:47,833 --> 00:33:49,125
I am a virgin. 

408
00:33:53,666 --> 00:33:54,833
Move. 

409
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,083
What did you say? - I have never.. 

410
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:07,041
You know.. I have never done it 

411
00:34:10,041 --> 00:34:11,583
I never got the time. 

412
00:34:12,666 --> 00:34:15,416
First I focused on studies and then my job. 

413
00:34:16,041 --> 00:34:18,041
And it wasn't like I didn't have my opportunities.. 

414
00:34:19,166 --> 00:34:22,041
Its just that I was waiting for the right girl. 

415
00:34:23,916 --> 00:34:25,583
What? What is so funny? 

416
00:34:27,166 --> 00:34:31,833
You're talking like a 15 year old girl. 

417
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:36,458
In fact.. even 15 year old girls don't talk like that here.. 

418
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:38,833
If I had a 15 year old daughter and she didn't talk like this.. 

419
00:34:38,916 --> 00:34:40,375
..I'd break her legs 

420
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,458
I am sure. 

421
00:34:41,541 --> 00:34:44,875
But to have a 15 year old daughter, you have to first be a father. 

422
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:47,916
And to be a father.. you have to.. - Yes, I know. 

423
00:34:51,125 --> 00:34:52,500
Okay. 

424
00:34:53,041 --> 00:34:54,791
But you're a lucky guy. 

425
00:34:55,125 --> 00:34:57,583
Because tomorrow's the night. 

426
00:34:58,458 --> 00:35:00,166
Where, ladies and gentlemen.. 

427
00:35:00,291 --> 00:35:03,208
..a wish, a dream will be fulfilled. 

428
00:35:03,708 --> 00:35:06,083
A wish will come true. 

429
00:35:07,416 --> 00:35:08,833
Akash. Blush. 

430
00:35:08,916 --> 00:35:10,291
Blush. Akash. 

431
00:35:11,666 --> 00:35:12,875
Are you serious? 

432
00:35:12,958 --> 00:35:16,958
Yeah.. Isn't she gorgeous? - Gorgeous? 

433
00:35:17,958 --> 00:35:20,458
She'll feel bad. She's very sensitive. 

434
00:35:22,625 --> 00:35:25,208
She'll feel bad? - Yes. 

435
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:30,291
Hi, baby, did you miss me because I missed you too. 

436
00:35:44,166 --> 00:35:48,291
You missed me my blushy-wushy googly-poogly. 

437
00:35:48,375 --> 00:35:49,583
Yeah. 

438
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:11,833
Does she work? or are we just here to pay her a visit? 

439
00:36:12,333 --> 00:36:13,416
I know, I know. 

440
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:16,208
He can be a pain but try to manage tonight. 

441
00:36:17,583 --> 00:36:20,500
The party starts now, baby. 

442
00:36:38,583 --> 00:36:40,041
What are we doing here, Kiara? 

443
00:36:40,125 --> 00:36:42,666
We've got to fulfil your last wish, remember? 

444
00:36:43,416 --> 00:36:44,916
Peshto. 

445
00:36:47,125 --> 00:36:49,041
How are you? - Oh my, God. How have you been? 

446
00:36:49,083 --> 00:36:50,666
When did you arrive? You didn't even call. 

447
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,291
I know, I was slightly busy. 

448
00:36:52,625 --> 00:36:54,791
Why do girls always meet each other.. 

449
00:36:54,958 --> 00:36:56,958
..like they've been just been let out of the mental asylum. 

450
00:36:57,083 --> 00:36:58,166
who is he? 

451
00:36:58,291 --> 00:36:59,583
That.. - Hi, Akash. 

452
00:36:59,666 --> 00:37:02,500
Akash. Oh, the virgin. 

453
00:37:02,583 --> 00:37:04,666
Isn't it cute, Sam? 

454
00:37:05,166 --> 00:37:08,041
Does everyone in this club know this? - Peshto. 

455
00:37:08,166 --> 00:37:10,208
Not really.. - Kiara. Sam. - Sam, Kiara. - Hi. 

456
00:37:10,333 --> 00:37:11,750
Hi. - Really nice to meet you. 

457
00:37:11,875 --> 00:37:13,708
Hi. - Pleasure to meet you. 

458
00:37:15,208 --> 00:37:17,291
Darling, I got to take this. - Okay. 

459
00:37:17,375 --> 00:37:18,750
God. - So, did you like Sam? 

460
00:37:18,875 --> 00:37:22,250
So cute, quite yum, I like him. - I know. 

461
00:37:22,333 --> 00:37:25,583
Isn't he just.. - You do know that he's married, right? 

462
00:37:25,666 --> 00:37:26,916
What? - What? 

463
00:37:27,041 --> 00:37:28,333
No. 

464
00:37:28,458 --> 00:37:29,541
I knew it. 

465
00:37:29,666 --> 00:37:31,208
He's talking to his wife right now 

466
00:37:31,458 --> 00:37:33,125
I can lip-read. 

467
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:35,833
You'll learn to too, if you work in the stock market long enough. 

468
00:37:36,958 --> 00:37:41,541
He's telling her that he is out entertaining some Chinese clients 

469
00:37:41,625 --> 00:37:44,458
But he was going to have dinner with me at Lobo tonight. 

470
00:37:44,541 --> 00:37:46,041
There ain't no Lobo tonight, my darling. 

471
00:37:46,208 --> 00:37:47,208
He's going back home. 

472
00:37:47,333 --> 00:37:49,833
Darling, I got to go. Some problem with the shipment, alright. 

473
00:37:49,958 --> 00:37:51,500
Bye. Take care. - Bye. 

474
00:37:51,583 --> 00:37:53,750
Bye, guys. - Bye. Pleasure meeting you. 

475
00:37:53,875 --> 00:37:55,083
C'mon Stay back. - I've to go. 

476
00:37:55,208 --> 00:37:56,250
No, stay back. - I've to go. 

477
00:37:56,375 --> 00:37:57,666
What about the party? - Work. - You.. 

478
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:59,500
Work! Bye. 

479
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:03,500
Screw it. 

480
00:38:03,583 --> 00:38:05,375
Anyway, he was quite boring. 

481
00:38:05,458 --> 00:38:07,333
And there are so many hot guys in here. 

482
00:38:07,458 --> 00:38:08,583
I'll see you guys later. 

483
00:38:08,666 --> 00:38:10,875
But listen.. - You guys have fun. 

484
00:38:10,958 --> 00:38:14,041
And you.. you're not too bad. 

485
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,041
Bye. - Bye. 

486
00:38:16,083 --> 00:38:17,625
Come on.. Let's hit the bar. 

487
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:19,541
Excuse me. Sorry. 

488
00:38:19,666 --> 00:38:21,166
Can I have two large jacks, please? 

489
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:22,791
Nice 

490
00:38:24,916 --> 00:38:27,583
So this, my friend, is your playground.. 

491
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:34,083
New York is officially the land of the single ladies. 

492
00:38:34,666 --> 00:38:37,291
But first, you'll have to loosen up a little. Just.. 

493
00:38:37,541 --> 00:38:39,083
I know what, have a drink. 

494
00:38:39,208 --> 00:38:41,750
Finish, finish, down, down, finish. 

495
00:38:42,291 --> 00:38:43,500
Kiara. 

496
00:38:44,625 --> 00:38:46,500
Now we're talking! 

497
00:38:49,625 --> 00:38:50,666
Keep your hand on the bar. 

498
00:38:50,791 --> 00:38:52,208
Just one hand. 

499
00:38:52,333 --> 00:38:53,583
Now Lean. 

500
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:56,041
Like that. 

501
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:58,083
Now, look around. 

502
00:38:58,458 --> 00:39:00,041
Look all around. 

503
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:03,500
Please, don't stare like a despo. 

504
00:39:03,625 --> 00:39:07,791
Smooth. Just like.. look around. Scan the place. 

505
00:39:08,125 --> 00:39:09,666
Nice. 

506
00:39:10,333 --> 00:39:11,458
Now pout. 

507
00:39:11,583 --> 00:39:13,208
Slightly. My god! 

508
00:39:13,333 --> 00:39:15,041
Okay. Cute. 

509
00:39:15,166 --> 00:39:17,208
Okay, so you're ready for the kill. 

510
00:39:17,333 --> 00:39:24,041
Now.. imagine that a very sexy, hot girl is standing next to you. 

511
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:27,416
Just imagine me, Now just hit on me 

512
00:39:29,916 --> 00:39:35,041
Can I get you a drink? - Why? 

513
00:39:35,958 --> 00:39:37,291
Are you a waiter? 

514
00:39:38,333 --> 00:39:39,833
No, thanks. 

515
00:39:42,083 --> 00:39:44,458
Can I buy you a drink? - Much better. 

516
00:39:45,666 --> 00:39:48,458
Why should I let you buy me a drink? 

517
00:39:49,166 --> 00:39:51,208
Because I've been noticing you for so long.. 

518
00:39:51,375 --> 00:39:54,125
Please. That's the tackiest pick-up line ever 

519
00:39:54,208 --> 00:39:56,458
I've been noticing you for so long. 

520
00:39:56,541 --> 00:39:58,458
I can buy my own drink. 

521
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:01,041
So buy me a drink. 

522
00:40:02,708 --> 00:40:04,041
Cheapo. 

523
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:12,458
So can I make you a drink? 

524
00:40:13,375 --> 00:40:15,666
Nice. Now that I like. 

525
00:40:17,291 --> 00:40:20,041
Hi, I am Akash. 

526
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:26,750
Kiara. - Unusual name. 

527
00:40:26,916 --> 00:40:29,041
Like me. - Yeah. 

528
00:40:30,125 --> 00:40:31,458
I like you. 

529
00:40:32,875 --> 00:40:34,875
Nice.. Continue. 

530
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:49,041
We've got news.. the enemy has advanced. 

531
00:40:50,916 --> 00:40:52,916
Their men are moving forward. 

532
00:40:53,583 --> 00:40:56,083
They've captured most of our men. 

533
00:40:58,916 --> 00:41:00,625
We don't have much time 

534
00:41:02,958 --> 00:41:09,375
But what will happen if they find you, Gopal? 

535
00:41:10,083 --> 00:41:12,083
There's nothing I can do. 

536
00:41:13,083 --> 00:41:17,541
Radha, I will have to stay back. 

537
00:41:19,041 --> 00:41:20,541
For my people. 

538
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:23,083
Till the end. 

539
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:28,375
You will have to leave. - But what about us? 

540
00:41:30,041 --> 00:41:33,375
All those dreams, those promises? 

541
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:35,791
Tell me. 

542
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,958
We have just this night. 

543
00:41:41,291 --> 00:41:42,750
This night. 

544
00:41:47,333 --> 00:41:48,916
This moment. 

545
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:57,166
You're good. 

546
00:41:59,541 --> 00:42:01,041
Okay. 

547
00:42:01,958 --> 00:42:04,541
I am starting to get to know you a little too well.. 

548
00:42:04,625 --> 00:42:06,750
..and I am not liking it. - Why? 

549
00:42:07,333 --> 00:42:10,083
You were better off, as a stranger. 

550
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:24,708
"All the Anjaana's say yeah, yeah, yeah" 

551
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:28,125
"All the Anjaani's say yeah, yeah, yeah" 

552
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:31,541
"All the Anjaana's say yeah, yeah, yeah" 

553
00:42:31,625 --> 00:42:35,375
"All the Anjaani's say yeah, yeah, yeah" 

554
00:42:35,458 --> 00:42:39,166
"I met a boy and his name is Anjaana." 

555
00:42:40,125 --> 00:42:45,875
"and I found a companion on an unknown path" 

556
00:42:47,666 --> 00:42:51,458
"I met a girl and her name is Anjaani." 

557
00:42:52,291 --> 00:42:58,041
"It was an unknown dream but it became my reality." 

558
00:42:59,166 --> 00:43:02,708
"That's how.. - The story goes." 

559
00:43:02,791 --> 00:43:06,083
"How did it start.. - No one knows." 

560
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:12,333
"Two strangers coincidentally met in a world so big." 

561
00:43:12,666 --> 00:43:19,208
"Anjaana.. Anjaani.." 

562
00:43:19,625 --> 00:43:25,916
"Together they spun a story." 

563
00:43:26,416 --> 00:43:33,375
"Anjaana.. Anjaani.." 

564
00:43:33,666 --> 00:43:39,041
"Together they spun a story." 

565
00:43:41,041 --> 00:43:44,458
"All the Anjaana's say yeah, yeah, yeah" 

566
00:43:44,541 --> 00:43:48,083
"All the Anjaani's say yeah, yeah, yeah" 

567
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:50,583
"All the Anjaana's.." 

568
00:43:51,458 --> 00:43:55,500
"All the Anjaani's say yeah, yeah, yeah" 

569
00:44:02,166 --> 00:44:05,750
"Live every moment like.. You've got only that moment to live." 

570
00:44:05,833 --> 00:44:09,291
"because no one knows.. what will happen tomorrow." 

571
00:44:09,375 --> 00:44:15,541
"Right now there's just happiness and you." 

572
00:44:16,083 --> 00:44:19,750
"If we.. If we meet we'll start talking." 

573
00:44:19,833 --> 00:44:23,125
"Wonder when.. We'll ever have a night like this again." 

574
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:28,875
"But now that we're together and it seems magical." 

575
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:31,958
"We don't have any worries." 

576
00:44:32,041 --> 00:44:33,750
"We don't want to think about sorrows." 

577
00:44:33,875 --> 00:44:37,000
"Lets move on.. before this journey ends." 

578
00:44:37,083 --> 00:44:44,458
"It seems that fate has fulfilled my unspoken desires." 

579
00:44:44,875 --> 00:44:51,041
"Anjaana.. Anjaani.." 

580
00:44:51,875 --> 00:44:57,041
"Together they spun a story." 

581
00:44:58,666 --> 00:45:05,333
"Anjaana.. Anjaani.." 

582
00:45:05,833 --> 00:45:12,041
"Together they spun a story." 

583
00:45:13,166 --> 00:45:16,458
"All the Anjaana's say yeah, yeah, yeah" 

584
00:45:16,583 --> 00:45:20,041
"All the Anjaani's say yeah, yeah, yeah" 

585
00:45:20,083 --> 00:45:22,000
"All the Anjaana's say yeah, yeah, yeah" 

586
00:45:22,083 --> 00:45:27,000
"All the Anjaani's say yeah, yeah, yeah" 

587
00:45:27,125 --> 00:45:30,500
"All the Anjaana's say yeah, yeah, yeah" 

588
00:45:30,708 --> 00:45:34,041
"All the Anjaani's say yeah, yeah, yeah" 

589
00:45:34,208 --> 00:45:35,958
"All the Anjaana's say yeah, yeah, yeah" 

590
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:41,000
"All the Anjaani's say yeah, yeah, yeah" 

591
00:45:41,166 --> 00:45:44,583
"All the Anjaana's say yeah, yeah, yeah" 

592
00:45:44,666 --> 00:45:48,083
"All the Anjaani's say yeah, yeah, yeah" 

593
00:45:48,208 --> 00:45:49,791
"All the Anjaana's say yeah, yeah, yeah" 

594
00:45:49,875 --> 00:45:54,833
"All the Anjaani's say yeah, yeah, yeah" 

595
00:46:05,541 --> 00:46:07,333
Hey, thanks. 

596
00:46:07,458 --> 00:46:08,833
Congrats. 

597
00:46:08,958 --> 00:46:11,166
Your first last wish has been fulfilled. 

598
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:12,750
Cheers. 

599
00:46:12,958 --> 00:46:15,708
I couldn't do it. - Why? 

600
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,291
Are you gay? - No, idiot. 

601
00:46:20,666 --> 00:46:21,958
Don't call me an idiot. 

602
00:46:22,208 --> 00:46:23,791
Firstly, I try to help you, and then.. 

603
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:28,541
It's just that I couldn't do it. 

604
00:46:33,208 --> 00:46:35,875
You should've told me earlier. 

605
00:46:35,958 --> 00:46:38,708
We could've seen a doctor. Listen, it's a very common problem 

606
00:46:38,833 --> 00:46:40,375
Listen, when I say I can't do it.. 

607
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:43,416
..I mean with a stranger, having paid her money 

608
00:46:44,041 --> 00:46:45,916
Is it so difficult to understand? 

609
00:46:46,833 --> 00:46:48,041
Look at me 

610
00:46:48,458 --> 00:46:50,333
You think I didn't have any girlfriends.. 

611
00:46:50,458 --> 00:46:52,208
or that I didn't get opportunities. 

612
00:46:52,833 --> 00:46:55,125
It's just that.. I never felt it was right. 

613
00:46:56,125 --> 00:46:59,291
I wanted to wait.. to fall in love. 

614
00:46:59,916 --> 00:47:03,083
I know it's stupid. But that's just the way it is. 

615
00:47:03,208 --> 00:47:07,041
Oh so basically you've Never been in love. 

616
00:47:07,208 --> 00:47:09,541
So that's your wish. 

617
00:47:10,208 --> 00:47:11,833
Oh, dude. 

618
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,041
That's a very difficult wish to fulfil. 

619
00:47:15,416 --> 00:47:18,791
But.. Love isn't easy.. 

620
00:47:18,958 --> 00:47:20,083
Oh no, just a minute. 

621
00:47:20,208 --> 00:47:21,875
I've got an original one. 

622
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:25,166
What wish is one that can be easily obtained. 

623
00:47:25,791 --> 00:47:28,041
What wish is one that can be easily obtained. 

624
00:47:28,375 --> 00:47:30,916
Where there is no struggle in fulfilling it. 

625
00:47:31,541 --> 00:47:33,916
Which once attained, should feel like an achievement 

626
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,041
Or else, life just goes by. 

627
00:47:37,833 --> 00:47:38,958
Thank you. Thank you. 

628
00:47:42,166 --> 00:47:43,750
That was very bad. 

629
00:47:45,416 --> 00:47:46,916
Oh, God. Come on. 

630
00:47:47,041 --> 00:47:50,833
You've got only 19 days.. to fall in love. 

631
00:47:54,875 --> 00:47:57,333
Hey, the car is this way. 

632
00:47:57,958 --> 00:47:59,208
Are you kidding me? 

633
00:47:59,541 --> 00:48:01,416
I don't drink and drive. 

634
00:48:01,708 --> 00:48:04,208
Okay, I'll drive. - Blush! 

635
00:48:05,041 --> 00:48:07,416
No way. Only I drive her. 

636
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:10,083
Come on, we're walking. 

637
00:48:22,625 --> 00:48:25,458
So the other day.. - Sorry. 

638
00:48:25,583 --> 00:48:28,041
Go ahead. - No, you were saying something. 

639
00:48:29,375 --> 00:48:34,333
Just that.. we've decided to live together for 20 days. 

640
00:48:34,458 --> 00:48:36,708
And we don't even know.. 

641
00:48:36,833 --> 00:48:40,625
..why we met on the bridge that night. 

642
00:48:43,583 --> 00:48:44,833
Go on. 

643
00:48:47,625 --> 00:48:49,333
Stock market crash. 

644
00:48:56,125 --> 00:48:58,208
So you lost everything? 

645
00:48:59,666 --> 00:49:01,041
And your family? 

646
00:49:02,541 --> 00:49:06,375
My parents got divorced when I was eight years old. 

647
00:49:07,166 --> 00:49:09,166
They kept fighting even after the divorce. 

648
00:49:09,916 --> 00:49:12,083
My grandfather rescued me, and brought me here 

649
00:49:12,583 --> 00:49:15,541
He educated me, sent me here. 

650
00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:17,958
He passed away in 2001. 

651
00:49:18,333 --> 00:49:20,125
And since then I am alone. 

652
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:26,083
Where are your parents now? - I.. don't know. 

653
00:49:27,916 --> 00:49:29,625
What do you mean, you don't know? 

654
00:49:30,375 --> 00:49:32,416
You don't even talk to them? 

655
00:49:32,666 --> 00:49:34,375
Well, neither do they. 

656
00:49:34,791 --> 00:49:36,541
So what, Akash? 

657
00:49:37,041 --> 00:49:38,583
Did you even try? 

658
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:41,125
Oh my, God. 

659
00:49:41,875 --> 00:49:45,833
Say it, I don't care, I didn't have time, blah, blah, blah. 

660
00:49:46,333 --> 00:49:49,666
I don't understand today's generation.. 

661
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,416
And you took your parent's permission.. 

662
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:52,875
..before committing suicide, isn't it? 

663
00:49:52,958 --> 00:49:54,750
You care a lot for them, don't you? 

664
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:02,375
So.. - What? 

665
00:50:03,416 --> 00:50:08,833
Your turn. - Oh look, we're home. 

666
00:50:15,041 --> 00:50:16,208
Kiara, where are you going? 

667
00:50:16,291 --> 00:50:18,333
Come on. 

668
00:50:34,083 --> 00:50:38,208
I lived in San Francisco with my family 

669
00:50:38,458 --> 00:50:44,041
Kunal and my family had known each other for a really long time. 

670
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:46,416
Especially since we had migrated from India together 

671
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,833
And that day, as usual Kunal forgot my birthday. 

672
00:50:51,166 --> 00:50:52,833
I had gotten used to it. 

673
00:50:53,125 --> 00:50:55,041
But still used to get angry on him. 

674
00:50:55,083 --> 00:50:57,916
He was used to this anger. 

675
00:51:00,833 --> 00:51:01,958
Yeah, dad? 

676
00:51:02,416 --> 00:51:06,666
Oh, Kunal hasn't called yet. - Goodnight, dad. 

677
00:51:06,875 --> 00:51:08,083
Goodnight, baby. 

678
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:16,833
I've been trying to call you all day.. 

679
00:51:17,041 --> 00:51:20,291
It either gets directed to voicemail or you just don't answer it. 

680
00:51:21,583 --> 00:51:23,208
Okay, fine. 

681
00:51:23,333 --> 00:51:25,708
I thought of calling you 

682
00:51:25,833 --> 00:51:29,833
And it's you that always says "It's the thought that counts". 

683
00:51:30,375 --> 00:51:32,708
I really thought of calling you. 

684
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,916
Kiara, it's your birthday. 

685
00:51:36,083 --> 00:51:39,375
Be nice to people. Smile. 

686
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:42,500
It's my birthday, and I should be nice to other people? 

687
00:51:42,583 --> 00:51:43,708
Yes, let's go now. 

688
00:51:43,833 --> 00:51:44,958
Come on, come on that's enough now. 

689
00:51:45,041 --> 00:51:46,500
I've got something to show you. 

690
00:51:48,916 --> 00:51:51,333
Happy birthday to you. 

691
00:51:51,416 --> 00:51:52,625
Happy birthday to you. 

692
00:51:52,708 --> 00:51:56,208
Look at her, isn't she gorgeous? - You like her? 

693
00:51:56,291 --> 00:51:58,125
Of course, Kunal. - Isn't it? 

694
00:51:58,291 --> 00:52:01,041
You're buying a gift for yourself on my birthday. 

695
00:52:01,083 --> 00:52:03,416
I mean how sweet is that. 

696
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:05,041
But, you do this every year. 

697
00:52:05,083 --> 00:52:07,291
Camera. Electric guitar. 

698
00:52:07,416 --> 00:52:08,708
Home theatre system. - Enough. 

699
00:52:08,833 --> 00:52:11,041
PS3. And now this bike, Which is for me. 

700
00:52:11,166 --> 00:52:12,708
All your gifts are for me. 

701
00:52:12,791 --> 00:52:14,375
Thanks so much Kunal, I am so touched. 

702
00:52:14,458 --> 00:52:16,791
I bought the camera to click your photographs.. 

703
00:52:16,875 --> 00:52:20,041
And the home theatre, was for us to watch movies together 

704
00:52:20,166 --> 00:52:21,250
And the guitar? 

705
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:23,416
That was to compose songs for you 

706
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:26,541
And the PS3? - PS3? 

707
00:52:26,708 --> 00:52:29,333
OK fine, that's one thing, that I bought for myself. 

708
00:52:29,458 --> 00:52:32,041
But this.. is for you to sit on. 

709
00:52:32,583 --> 00:52:36,416
And you know what.. we will run away on this 

710
00:52:39,333 --> 00:52:40,625
Come on. 

711
00:52:55,041 --> 00:52:56,291
Hey. 

712
00:53:05,333 --> 00:53:07,208
Hey, hi babe. - Hi. 

713
00:53:07,791 --> 00:53:09,166
So this is it. 

714
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:10,916
Fourteen days until the wedding.. 

715
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,875
..and I see what the problem is. 

716
00:53:12,958 --> 00:53:15,041
Your living room is your bedroom. 

717
00:53:15,166 --> 00:53:17,958
And the bedroom? - Is more like a storeroom. 

718
00:53:18,541 --> 00:53:20,666
Hey, babe, just pass me a beer. - Yes. 

719
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:22,125
I'll be right back. 

720
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:25,166
Hey, would you like a beer? - No, thank you 

721
00:53:26,125 --> 00:53:28,541
Maybe a glass of wine? 

722
00:53:29,416 --> 00:53:32,041
Or.. a cosmo? 

723
00:53:34,333 --> 00:53:36,125
I don't drink at work. 

724
00:53:37,041 --> 00:53:40,583
But here's my card. 

725
00:53:41,458 --> 00:53:43,125
Give me a call at night. 

726
00:53:43,708 --> 00:53:44,916
I'll drink anything. 

727
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,833
Okay, okay, break it up you two. 

728
00:53:46,916 --> 00:53:49,375
Emanuel is a dream worker, aren't you? 

729
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:51,875
Honey, I am your fairy Godmother. 

730
00:53:51,958 --> 00:53:54,750
We're going to transform this place. - Perfect. 

731
00:53:54,875 --> 00:53:56,208
He really is a fairy 

732
00:53:56,291 --> 00:53:57,500
Cheers. 

733
00:53:57,583 --> 00:53:59,416
Be nice. - Bye, Emanuel. 

734
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:02,916
Okay, - The DVD collection. 

735
00:54:19,208 --> 00:54:20,583
We'll talk later. 

736
00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:24,666
And anyway, I am feeling sleepy. 

737
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:49,250
What are you doing? - Its called cleaning. 

738
00:54:49,375 --> 00:54:52,916
You know, cleaning. - No, I don't know. 

739
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,708
And I don't want to know. 

740
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:56,666
You know, for the first time.. 

741
00:54:56,750 --> 00:54:58,916
..I don't have anything to do after 9 o'clock. 

742
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,375
So I thought I'd do this. 

743
00:55:00,791 --> 00:55:05,458
Where did this sofa come from? - This one? 

744
00:55:05,583 --> 00:55:08,166
Yes. - It's your sofa. 

745
00:55:08,666 --> 00:55:09,958
No. - Yes. 

746
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,958
It was hidden behind your pile of clothes. 

747
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:16,791
And yes.. I found your house key. 

748
00:55:16,916 --> 00:55:19,833
Or should I say.. keys. 

749
00:55:32,583 --> 00:55:34,208
Coffee. Low fat. 

750
00:55:34,583 --> 00:55:38,041
What. I like full fat. - You're most welcome. 

751
00:55:39,208 --> 00:55:41,458
Day 3, your turn to make a wish 

752
00:55:45,875 --> 00:55:49,166
Why am I.. so scared of your wish? 

753
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:52,583
Okay. 

754
00:55:52,708 --> 00:55:54,875
Let's just forget about these wishes. 

755
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,541
It's a bad idea anyway. - Why? 

756
00:55:56,833 --> 00:55:58,625
Now that it's my turn, suddenly it's a bad idea? 

757
00:55:58,750 --> 00:56:00,166
It's not like my wish has been fulfilled either. 

758
00:56:00,291 --> 00:56:02,541
I will get your wish fulfilled. 

759
00:56:02,666 --> 00:56:05,500
It will take time though.. And anyway we've got 19 days. 

760
00:56:05,625 --> 00:56:06,875
Yeah right. 

761
00:56:07,333 --> 00:56:09,333
Tell me.. or I'll just die out of suspense. 

762
00:56:09,458 --> 00:56:11,458
So my wish is that we'll swim.. 

763
00:56:11,541 --> 00:56:15,875
..in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, today. 

764
00:56:16,666 --> 00:56:18,083
What? - Yes. 

765
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:19,291
That's dumb. 

766
00:56:19,416 --> 00:56:22,041
Its minus two degrees and I don't indulge in such madness. 

767
00:56:22,208 --> 00:56:25,583
Oh, so your wish is "Beautiful, special, you won't understand".. 

768
00:56:25,708 --> 00:56:27,125
..and my wish is dumb? 

769
00:56:27,291 --> 00:56:29,666
Kiara, that is suicide. - Really? 

770
00:56:31,375 --> 00:56:32,625
Fine. 

771
00:56:33,750 --> 00:56:35,875
Is this why you've kept me alive? 

772
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:41,750
"I will follow." 

773
00:56:41,916 --> 00:56:44,708
"Anywhere you lead me." 

774
00:56:45,041 --> 00:56:48,166
"I will follow you." 

775
00:56:49,375 --> 00:56:52,125
"Yeah, every time you show the way." 

776
00:56:52,250 --> 00:56:58,750
Bathing in the sea has made you even more salty 

777
00:57:10,875 --> 00:57:12,541
Wouldn't it be so easy.. 

778
00:57:12,958 --> 00:57:15,041
to forget everything and live each day happily.. 

779
00:57:15,666 --> 00:57:18,791
To fulfil your every wish, like its your last day 

780
00:57:25,708 --> 00:57:28,333
But life always interferes. 

781
00:57:39,083 --> 00:57:41,750
Here. Write. - What? 

782
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,791
What you just said? 

783
00:57:44,083 --> 00:57:46,791
Live each day like it's your last. 

784
00:57:47,041 --> 00:57:49,625
Why? - Just write it. 

785
00:57:53,666 --> 00:57:54,916
Leave. 

786
00:58:03,125 --> 00:58:04,916
I wish that someone.. 

787
00:58:05,583 --> 00:58:08,041
..without a reason to live, finds this. 

788
00:58:15,750 --> 00:58:17,958
I wish that there's no one like that. 

789
00:58:25,875 --> 00:58:26,916
Okay, its bikini time. 

790
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,083
Akash, where is my bag with the swimsuit. 

791
00:58:29,208 --> 00:58:31,791
It must be there. - I don't really see it. 

792
00:58:33,541 --> 00:58:36,041
I am sorry.. I forgot that bag on the jetty. 

793
00:58:36,125 --> 00:58:37,625
What? - Yes. 

794
00:58:37,750 --> 00:58:39,541
No, Akash. - I am so sorry. 

795
00:58:39,666 --> 00:58:41,083
Come on, let's go back. 

796
00:58:41,166 --> 00:58:43,333
Just a minute, we aren't going anywhere. 

797
00:58:43,416 --> 00:58:45,750
How will we swim without our swim suits? 

798
00:58:46,666 --> 00:58:49,333
Actually, I can. - How? 

799
00:58:51,250 --> 00:58:53,208
Oh, come on. 

800
00:58:55,916 --> 00:58:57,333
I have this. 

801
00:59:00,666 --> 00:59:02,458
I am not going to take off my clothes. 

802
00:59:02,583 --> 00:59:04,916
I am not shameless like you. 

803
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:07,041
I am shameless? - Of course. 

804
00:59:07,125 --> 00:59:09,791
There's no one around here for atleast 10 kilometres, to see you. 

805
00:59:10,291 --> 00:59:13,041
Look, I have no interest in seeing you undress 

806
00:59:13,166 --> 00:59:15,750
Hey, watch it. - What else can I say? 

807
00:59:16,041 --> 00:59:18,083
I am very interested in seeing you undress. 

808
00:59:18,166 --> 00:59:20,166
But I control myself. Happy? 

809
00:59:22,708 --> 00:59:24,166
That's why I think we should go back 

810
00:59:24,250 --> 00:59:25,750
Don't put up a charade. 

811
00:59:29,083 --> 00:59:30,208
Crazy woman. 

812
00:59:30,291 --> 00:59:32,166
Wants to swim here in the cold. 

813
00:59:33,333 --> 00:59:36,708
Akash.. My leg.. - Kiara! 

814
00:59:36,833 --> 00:59:38,791
Akash. - Kiara! 

815
00:59:42,458 --> 00:59:43,666
Kiara, catch! 

816
00:59:45,541 --> 00:59:46,875
Catch! 

817
00:59:49,208 --> 00:59:50,875
Oh God. 

818
00:59:54,083 --> 00:59:59,458
Help! Help! I can't swim. 

819
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,208
Akash. 

820
01:00:02,875 --> 01:00:04,708
I can't swim. 

821
01:00:05,250 --> 01:00:06,416
The boat. 

822
01:00:06,541 --> 01:00:09,916
The boat's drifting away, Akash. 

823
01:00:16,958 --> 01:00:19,541
Is this why you forgot the bag? because you can't swim. 

824
01:00:19,666 --> 01:00:21,125
If you weren't acting that you're drowning.. 

825
01:00:21,208 --> 01:00:22,666
..we wouldn't be here and the boat wouldn't have drifted away 

826
01:00:22,791 --> 01:00:24,458
So, now it's my fault? - Of course it's your fault. 

827
01:00:24,583 --> 01:00:27,333
Is it my fault that you can't swim? 

828
01:00:27,458 --> 01:00:30,000
I wonder which era you've landed here from. 

829
01:00:30,083 --> 01:00:31,208
Now, I am stuck with you. 

830
01:00:37,708 --> 01:00:39,666
I want to pee. - What? 

831
01:00:40,041 --> 01:00:42,083
Here? Right now? - Yes. 

832
01:00:42,875 --> 01:00:46,375
You.. you can't do it here. - What do you mean? 

833
01:00:46,458 --> 01:00:48,416
How long can I control it? - I don't know. 

834
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:50,750
But doing it in the water, that's disgusting Akash. 

835
01:00:51,041 --> 01:00:53,041
Why.. why don't you swim a little ahead? 

836
01:00:53,166 --> 01:00:54,833
The waves will take it away 

837
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:55,875
Ew.. 

838
01:00:55,958 --> 01:00:57,416
A wave like that one. 

839
01:00:59,916 --> 01:01:03,166
Akash, what's that? 

840
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:07,083
Is that a shark? 

841
01:01:09,375 --> 01:01:11,416
No, no, that's not a shark. 

842
01:01:11,541 --> 01:01:13,833
It looks like a floating cloth. 

843
01:01:15,750 --> 01:01:18,333
It looks like someone's boxers. 

844
01:01:29,041 --> 01:01:30,083
You pervert. 

845
01:01:30,208 --> 01:01:32,083
And I was standing next to you all this while 

846
01:01:32,166 --> 01:01:33,375
Disgusting. 

847
01:01:36,583 --> 01:01:38,041
My boxers. 

848
01:01:38,333 --> 01:01:40,125
Go get them 

849
01:01:40,916 --> 01:01:43,041
I told you I don't know how to swim. 

850
01:01:43,166 --> 01:01:44,833
Could you please get them for me? 

851
01:01:44,916 --> 01:01:46,375
I am not going to touch your boxers. 

852
01:01:46,458 --> 01:01:48,666
Please, they'll float away. 

853
01:01:48,750 --> 01:01:51,375
And I certainly don't want to die without them. Please. 

854
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,125
Thanks. 

855
01:02:31,333 --> 01:02:38,291
I am sorry for all this. - Its okay. 

856
01:02:40,041 --> 01:02:43,875
Anyway, you look rather strange saying sorry. 

857
01:02:47,166 --> 01:02:48,875
You're better grumpy. 

858
01:02:55,833 --> 01:03:01,166
You think we should hug.. 

859
01:03:01,958 --> 01:03:04,208
It's very cold. 

860
01:03:29,166 --> 01:03:30,875
Its so strange, isn't it? 

861
01:03:32,708 --> 01:03:35,666
We tried so hard to die but couldn't. 

862
01:03:37,916 --> 01:03:40,291
And today when we tried to live a little.. 

863
01:03:47,708 --> 01:03:51,166
Anyway, you didn't complete your story. 

864
01:03:53,333 --> 01:03:56,291
There's no one here to disturb us now. 

865
01:04:05,041 --> 01:04:08,458
Hey, its me Rachael. Can't wait to see you. 

866
01:04:08,708 --> 01:04:11,166
It's been five months since that night in LA. 

867
01:04:11,250 --> 01:04:13,333
Finally you agreed to see me again. 

868
01:04:14,166 --> 01:04:16,291
I forgot to give you my room number. I am at the Hilton.. 

869
01:04:16,416 --> 01:04:20,583
And the room number is.. same as the one we were in LA. 

870
01:04:21,375 --> 01:04:24,916
I'll be waiting.. 6pm.. Don't be late. 

871
01:04:39,416 --> 01:04:40,833
Hi. - Hi. 

872
01:04:40,958 --> 01:04:44,041
A friend of mine from LA, her name is Rachael. 

873
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:46,083
Could I have her room number please? 

874
01:04:46,208 --> 01:04:48,000
I am sorry I can't give out that information.. 

875
01:04:48,125 --> 01:04:50,125
..but I can go ahead and give her a call for you. 

876
01:04:50,458 --> 01:04:51,916
Ya, please. 

877
01:04:52,666 --> 01:04:53,958
There she is. 

878
01:04:58,458 --> 01:04:59,875
Thank you. 

879
01:05:06,208 --> 01:05:07,500
Hi. 

880
01:05:09,208 --> 01:05:10,625
What floor? 

881
01:05:11,583 --> 01:05:12,958
Same floor. 

882
01:05:24,833 --> 01:05:27,041
Have a good night - You too. 

883
01:05:55,250 --> 01:05:57,708
I am ready now, your room is done. 

884
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:04,708
Thanks. 

885
01:06:20,041 --> 01:06:22,166
Hello. - Hey, Kiara. 

886
01:06:22,291 --> 01:06:23,541
Hi Babes 

887
01:06:24,375 --> 01:06:27,083
Kunal where are you? - Are you alright. 

888
01:06:27,416 --> 01:06:29,625
I am at the restaurant, why? 

889
01:06:32,208 --> 01:06:33,583
No, it's nothing. 

890
01:06:33,666 --> 01:06:36,333
I'll call you later, okay. - Okay. 

891
01:07:31,041 --> 01:07:33,916
"Falling asleep at the wheel." 

892
01:07:34,208 --> 01:07:39,916
"Am still dreaming and still wheeling." 

893
01:07:43,708 --> 01:07:50,375
"It's not where I expected to be. Am still wheeling." 

894
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:53,291
Can I get a beer? - Cheers. 

895
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,291
Hey, can I buy you a drink? 

896
01:08:03,583 --> 01:08:08,250
"O God, am lost. Am drawn out so far." 

897
01:08:08,333 --> 01:08:14,458
"O God.." 

898
01:08:14,583 --> 01:08:17,500
"O God.." 

899
01:08:17,583 --> 01:08:22,375
"Am drawn out so far." 

900
01:08:29,416 --> 01:08:30,041
Yeah. 

901
01:08:51,375 --> 01:08:56,208
Why god.. 

902
01:08:59,458 --> 01:09:05,666
Why is my love so cursed 

903
01:09:06,958 --> 01:09:09,208
Why god.. 

904
01:09:09,541 --> 01:09:13,041
'And you know what.. we will run away on this' 

905
01:09:39,041 --> 01:09:50,416
Why god.. Why is my love so cursed? 

906
01:09:51,833 --> 01:10:06,500
And my heart shattered by his betrayal 

907
01:10:19,958 --> 01:10:21,708
What happened to your hair? 

908
01:10:23,750 --> 01:10:25,125
New look 

909
01:10:27,041 --> 01:10:31,041
But I loved your hair, Kiara. - I know. 

910
01:10:32,625 --> 01:10:35,916
You'll get used to this as well. - What's wrong? 

911
01:10:37,041 --> 01:10:42,375
Is there something that you want to tell me? - No, nothing. 

912
01:10:44,833 --> 01:10:47,958
Is there something I should know, Kunal? 

913
01:10:49,458 --> 01:10:51,208
Kiara, what's wrong with you today? 

914
01:10:52,291 --> 01:10:54,916
Anyway, I have to go to the restaurant.. 

915
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,375
..for an important meeting. 

916
01:10:56,458 --> 01:10:58,208
Snap out of it. 

917
01:11:00,875 --> 01:11:02,666
A meeting like last night's? 

918
01:11:07,083 --> 01:11:08,916
Like the one at the Hilton Hotel? 

919
01:11:11,166 --> 01:11:13,666
Like the one in room no. 504? 

920
01:11:19,666 --> 01:11:21,041
Who is she? 

921
01:11:27,458 --> 01:11:29,833
Rachael, from LA. 

922
01:11:31,041 --> 01:11:33,041
I met her five months ago. 

923
01:11:34,458 --> 01:11:37,166
And you had the nerve to give me this when you got back.. 

924
01:11:37,416 --> 01:11:39,416
No, Kiara. No. 

925
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:42,041
Please. That was the first and the last time. 

926
01:11:42,333 --> 01:11:45,166
I just went there yesterday, to tell her that it's over. 

927
01:11:45,666 --> 01:11:46,875
It's over. 

928
01:11:46,958 --> 01:11:49,291
Kiara, please forgive me. 

929
01:11:49,458 --> 01:11:50,708
We don't need this. 

930
01:11:50,791 --> 01:11:52,541
We're getting married in two weeks. 

931
01:11:52,625 --> 01:11:54,625
I'll keep you very happy. 

932
01:11:55,166 --> 01:11:57,208
I don't know why I strayed? 

933
01:11:59,166 --> 01:12:00,666
Please forgive me. Please. 

934
01:12:00,750 --> 01:12:06,625
I promise. I won't do it again. Please. 

935
01:12:06,708 --> 01:12:13,958
Okay. I forgive you. - Really? 

936
01:12:15,166 --> 01:12:16,958
I forgive you, Kunal. 

937
01:12:18,208 --> 01:12:20,583
But you will have to forgive me as well. 

938
01:12:21,750 --> 01:12:26,708
Because last night I did exactly what you did, Kunal. 

939
01:12:28,333 --> 01:12:30,208
I slept with someone. 

940
01:12:32,041 --> 01:12:33,208
Please, Kunal. 

941
01:12:34,041 --> 01:12:35,583
Please forgive me. 

942
01:12:36,208 --> 01:12:37,750
This will never happen again. 

943
01:12:37,833 --> 01:12:39,083
I promise. 

944
01:12:39,416 --> 01:12:40,750
We're getting married in two weeks, Kunal. 

945
01:12:40,875 --> 01:12:42,041
We don't need this. 

946
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:44,208
I will keep you very happy, Kunal. 

947
01:12:45,041 --> 01:12:46,625
I don't know why I strayed? 

948
01:12:46,958 --> 01:12:49,125
This won't happen again, Kunal. I promise. 

949
01:12:57,041 --> 01:12:58,750
Forgive me, Kunal. 

950
01:13:17,250 --> 01:13:24,500
I tried a lot.. to live without him. 

951
01:13:28,666 --> 01:13:30,416
But I failed. 

952
01:13:33,458 --> 01:13:37,708
Every single time.. I just failed. 

953
01:13:43,833 --> 01:13:50,291
"Everyone fades away with time." 

954
01:13:50,375 --> 01:14:03,916
"Except for the one who accepts every difficulty as My will." 

955
01:14:05,833 --> 01:14:08,875
"When you're completely alone." 

956
01:14:08,958 --> 01:14:11,791
'I will always be besides you" 

957
01:14:11,875 --> 01:14:17,166
"I was never separate from you." 

958
01:14:17,291 --> 01:14:23,041
"You're unaware that God's around." 

959
01:14:23,083 --> 01:14:28,708
"You're unaware that God's around." 

960
01:14:29,125 --> 01:14:35,041
"You're unaware that God's around." 

961
01:14:35,125 --> 01:14:40,833
"You're unaware that God's around." 

962
01:14:41,083 --> 01:14:46,791
"You're unaware that God's around." 

963
01:14:47,041 --> 01:14:52,833
"You're unaware that God's around." 

964
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:58,916
"You're unaware that God's around." - Kiara. 

965
01:14:59,166 --> 01:15:03,666
"You're unaware that God's around." - Kiara. 

966
01:15:04,666 --> 01:15:05,958
Kiara. 

967
01:15:48,125 --> 01:15:50,041
'When you want to do something like this.. 

968
01:15:50,083 --> 01:15:53,500
..you shouldn't think about it so much, you should just do it.' 

969
01:16:11,166 --> 01:16:13,250
We need to shift the patient to the.. - Excuse me, doctor. 

970
01:16:13,333 --> 01:16:14,416
One minute. 

971
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:16,708
All the.. - My friend is in there. 

972
01:16:16,833 --> 01:16:18,041
How is she? 

973
01:16:19,916 --> 01:16:21,291
My friend, how is she? 

974
01:16:21,416 --> 01:16:22,708
She's fine. 

975
01:16:23,833 --> 01:16:24,958
We saved her life.. 

976
01:16:25,041 --> 01:16:27,875
..so that she can go out and try to commit suicide again. 

977
01:16:28,791 --> 01:16:30,333
May I ask you what is wrong with her? 

978
01:16:30,583 --> 01:16:32,041
Did she have a fight with someone? 

979
01:16:32,125 --> 01:16:34,958
Did she lose her job or was she betrayed? 

980
01:16:36,333 --> 01:16:38,583
It must be some stupid reason like that, isn't it? 

981
01:16:39,708 --> 01:16:42,166
Have some problem, so do you want to commit suicide? 

982
01:16:43,791 --> 01:16:47,458
You kids don't value life. 

983
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,375
Look at that man. 

984
01:16:53,875 --> 01:16:55,833
He has terminal cancer. 

985
01:16:56,541 --> 01:16:58,500
He has undergone four surgeries.. 

986
01:16:58,958 --> 01:17:00,500
..and yet wants to live. 

987
01:17:01,041 --> 01:17:03,541
So that his family keeps smiling. 

988
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,541
Unfortunately we won't be able to save him. 

989
01:17:11,125 --> 01:17:15,041
And the one we saved doesn't want to live. 

990
01:17:16,708 --> 01:17:18,750
What is wrong with you kids? 

991
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,500
Why don't you understand.. 

992
01:17:23,916 --> 01:17:25,958
..that when someone dies, they don't die alone? 

993
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,291
Excuse me. 

994
01:18:13,291 --> 01:18:26,041
"All the marks erases." 

995
01:18:57,208 --> 01:19:02,041
"Now you're the reason.. for every happiness." 

996
01:19:02,250 --> 01:19:06,916
"Now you're my sunshine each day." 

997
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:12,708
"Now everything will begin with you." 

998
01:19:12,833 --> 01:19:17,375
"Now every path will lead only to you." 

999
01:19:17,625 --> 01:19:22,875
"Now I am sure that my life belongs to you." 

1000
01:19:22,958 --> 01:19:28,041
"Now I am sure that my life belongs to you." 

1001
01:19:28,125 --> 01:19:29,833
Akash, She's absolutely fine. 

1002
01:19:31,125 --> 01:19:40,583
"Everything starts with you now that you are with me" 

1003
01:19:41,625 --> 01:19:50,625
"Everything starts with you now that you are with me" 

1004
01:19:51,875 --> 01:19:53,375
"I wait for the signs so I know you are mine" 

1005
01:19:53,458 --> 01:19:56,875
"Everytime I look in the mirror, I see your face" 

1006
01:19:56,958 --> 01:19:59,125
"The walls break down down when you smile at me" 

1007
01:19:59,250 --> 01:20:01,750
"And the world's much brighter than the one I see" 

1008
01:20:01,875 --> 01:20:03,916
"I wait for the signs so I know you are mine" 

1009
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:07,125
"Everytime I look in the mirror, I see your face" 

1010
01:20:07,250 --> 01:20:09,625
"The walls break down down when you smile at me" 

1011
01:20:09,750 --> 01:20:12,458
"And the world's much brighter than the one I see" 

1012
01:20:12,583 --> 01:20:18,791
"I will follow you everywhere.. like your shadow." 

1013
01:20:18,875 --> 01:20:23,000
"And never let you be alone." 

1014
01:20:23,083 --> 01:20:31,875
"I still couldn't find.. the moment that'd make you happy." 

1015
01:20:33,333 --> 01:20:38,125
"Whenever life tries to hurt you." 

1016
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:43,375
"I will hide you in my arms and protect you." 

1017
01:20:43,875 --> 01:20:48,791
"Now I am sure my life belongs to you." 

1018
01:20:49,041 --> 01:20:54,500
"Now I am sure my life belongs to you." 

1019
01:20:54,583 --> 01:21:03,333
"Everything starts with you now that you are with me" 

1020
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:13,791
"Everything starts with you now that you are with me" 

1021
01:21:33,750 --> 01:21:40,458
"I was unaware of your importance in the past." 

1022
01:21:41,583 --> 01:21:48,583
"I never knew that each moment will belong to you." 

1023
01:21:48,791 --> 01:21:52,750
"I request you." 

1024
01:21:52,875 --> 01:21:59,041
"Learn to live again." 

1025
01:21:59,333 --> 01:22:04,500
"Now I am sure my life belongs to you." 

1026
01:22:04,625 --> 01:22:10,041
"Now I am sure my life belongs to you." 

1027
01:22:12,875 --> 01:22:22,000
"Everything starts with you whenever you're around." 

1028
01:22:23,333 --> 01:22:31,583
"Everything starts with you whenever you're around." 

1029
01:22:33,416 --> 01:22:35,625
"I wait for the signs so I know you are mine" 

1030
01:22:35,750 --> 01:22:38,500
"Everytime I look in the mirror, I see your face" 

1031
01:22:38,625 --> 01:22:40,958
"The walls break down down when you smile at me" 

1032
01:22:41,041 --> 01:22:43,458
"And the world's much brighter than the one I see" 

1033
01:22:43,583 --> 01:22:45,750
"I wait for the signs so I know you are mine" 

1034
01:22:45,833 --> 01:22:48,875
"Everytime I look in the mirror, I see your face" 

1035
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,333
"The walls break down down when you smile at me" 

1036
01:22:51,458 --> 01:22:54,666
"And the world's much brighter than the one I see" 

1037
01:23:14,041 --> 01:23:15,916
You're such a coward! 

1038
01:23:16,250 --> 01:23:18,291
Why are you hovering over me like a ghost? 

1039
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:20,125
What do you mean by "Hovering"? 

1040
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,250
What do you want, Akash? 

1041
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:27,166
Alright! Day six. Your turn to wish 

1042
01:23:27,291 --> 01:23:28,416
Tell me what you want to do? 

1043
01:23:28,541 --> 01:23:29,666
Bungee jumping. 

1044
01:23:29,750 --> 01:23:32,083
Sky-diving.. I know what, let's swim again. 

1045
01:23:32,208 --> 01:23:33,375
I've learnt how to swim now. 

1046
01:23:33,458 --> 01:23:35,041
Come on, say anything. 

1047
01:23:35,125 --> 01:23:39,041
Are you alright? - Lets do something spontaneous, adventurous, fun. 

1048
01:23:40,041 --> 01:23:42,791
These three words.. and you? 

1049
01:23:44,625 --> 01:23:46,791
Are you on drugs? - Shut up. 

1050
01:23:46,916 --> 01:23:48,458
Come on, say something. 

1051
01:23:52,958 --> 01:23:57,416
I want to go somewhere far? - Where? 

1052
01:24:00,750 --> 01:24:02,083
Wait. 

1053
01:24:05,291 --> 01:24:06,791
Come on. - What? 

1054
01:24:06,875 --> 01:24:08,083
Stand up. 

1055
01:24:08,500 --> 01:24:10,833
That's a map and these are darts. 

1056
01:24:10,916 --> 01:24:13,416
We will go wherever the dart lands. 

1057
01:24:13,541 --> 01:24:15,166
You know like a holiday. 

1058
01:24:16,083 --> 01:24:20,083
Let it be, I was just kidding, Akash. 

1059
01:24:20,875 --> 01:24:22,583
Like that stupid swimming wish. 

1060
01:24:22,666 --> 01:24:25,041
I don't have any wishes. - Wait, wait. 

1061
01:24:25,125 --> 01:24:27,833
This could be my wish. 

1062
01:24:28,416 --> 01:24:31,041
You know, I've never been on a holiday. 

1063
01:24:31,166 --> 01:24:34,750
So I don't even know what a holiday is.. what happens on one. 

1064
01:24:35,291 --> 01:24:37,000
Never? - Yes. 

1065
01:24:37,083 --> 01:24:39,041
Really? - Really. 

1066
01:24:40,041 --> 01:24:41,791
But that's not really important. 

1067
01:24:42,291 --> 01:24:44,166
I could just carry on without knowing what it feels like. 

1068
01:24:44,541 --> 01:24:45,875
How does it matter? 

1069
01:24:50,416 --> 01:24:51,958
Hang on. 

1070
01:24:52,583 --> 01:24:54,791
You know what we should do this. 

1071
01:24:54,875 --> 01:24:56,250
In fact, we will do this. 

1072
01:24:56,375 --> 01:24:57,500
Give those to me. 

1073
01:24:57,625 --> 01:24:59,208
Really. - Yes, lets go. 

1074
01:25:00,166 --> 01:25:01,541
Come on. 

1075
01:25:03,791 --> 01:25:05,416
Where has it landed? 

1076
01:25:06,500 --> 01:25:08,958
Hell. - Is Hell even a place? 

1077
01:25:09,041 --> 01:25:10,125
It's in Michigan. 

1078
01:25:10,250 --> 01:25:11,625
Do you want to go there? 

1079
01:25:11,750 --> 01:25:12,958
Are you mad? 

1080
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,166
Did I hit it right this time? 

1081
01:25:14,291 --> 01:25:16,500
I don't know. It's on some desert. 

1082
01:25:16,750 --> 01:25:18,041
Move. 

1083
01:25:19,666 --> 01:25:21,166
You didn't see it right.. 

1084
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:26,625
It's Vegas. 

1085
01:25:27,083 --> 01:25:28,916
But what will we do in Vegas? 

1086
01:25:29,041 --> 01:25:32,666
Dude, you've no idea how much fun we'll have. 

1087
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:38,166
Alright, let's go to Vegas. 

1088
01:25:38,583 --> 01:25:40,000
But we don't have the money to take a flight. 

1089
01:25:40,083 --> 01:25:41,916
I'll inquire about the greyhound bus. 

1090
01:25:46,416 --> 01:25:51,958
Akash. Let's drive? - Blush? 

1091
01:25:55,083 --> 01:25:56,416
Okay. 

1092
01:26:28,250 --> 01:26:32,791
"The winds are blowing slowly." 

1093
01:26:32,875 --> 01:26:37,500
"The paths are unfolding slowly." 

1094
01:26:37,583 --> 01:26:41,875
"All the paths to our destination are lit." 

1095
01:26:41,958 --> 01:26:46,458
"Like the stars of the sky have descended on earth." 

1096
01:26:46,625 --> 01:26:54,833
"There's a bright trail in the air." 

1097
01:26:56,416 --> 01:26:58,291
"It's amazing." 

1098
01:26:58,375 --> 01:26:59,541
"It's amazing." 

1099
01:26:59,625 --> 01:27:00,750
"It's amazing." 

1100
01:27:00,875 --> 01:27:05,291
"With you every moment is beautiful." 

1101
01:27:05,541 --> 01:27:07,458
"It's amazing." 

1102
01:27:07,583 --> 01:27:08,750
"It's amazing." 

1103
01:27:08,875 --> 01:27:10,250
"It's amazing." 

1104
01:27:10,375 --> 01:27:14,625
"With you every moment is beautiful." 

1105
01:27:23,541 --> 01:27:32,666
"as the evening sets in, there is a new ray that hits us" 

1106
01:27:32,791 --> 01:27:37,625
"it almost feels like its a new morning again" 

1107
01:27:39,708 --> 01:27:53,958
"darkness seems to be so far away" 

1108
01:27:56,333 --> 01:27:58,708
"hidden in the darkness are our secret desires" 

1109
01:27:58,791 --> 01:28:01,333
"and in a barren desert, we seek the rains" 

1110
01:28:01,416 --> 01:28:05,333
"and the heart starts beating faster" 

1111
01:28:05,458 --> 01:28:09,958
"as every moment feels all new" 

1112
01:28:10,041 --> 01:28:14,791
"and a new story begins" 

1113
01:28:14,916 --> 01:28:16,458
"It's amazing." 

1114
01:28:16,541 --> 01:28:17,750
"It's amazing." 

1115
01:28:17,875 --> 01:28:19,333
"It's amazing." 

1116
01:28:19,458 --> 01:28:23,708
"With you every moment is beautiful." 

1117
01:28:24,083 --> 01:28:25,916
"It's amazing." 

1118
01:28:26,041 --> 01:28:27,125
"It's amazing." 

1119
01:28:27,250 --> 01:28:28,708
"It's amazing." 

1120
01:28:28,833 --> 01:28:33,083
"With you every moment is beautiful." 

1121
01:28:47,666 --> 01:28:49,375
Are you alright? 

1122
01:28:49,708 --> 01:28:51,041
Yes, I am fine. 

1123
01:28:51,250 --> 01:28:52,416
What happened? 

1124
01:28:53,166 --> 01:28:55,041
Let me see what's wrong? - Listen. 

1125
01:28:55,833 --> 01:28:57,625
Wait here, I'll check. 

1126
01:29:06,958 --> 01:29:09,041
Blush. Blush. 

1127
01:29:12,166 --> 01:29:16,541
What's so funny? - Nothing. 

1128
01:29:16,666 --> 01:29:18,333
Come on, start the car. 

1129
01:29:20,916 --> 01:29:22,416
Are you okay? 

1130
01:29:22,541 --> 01:29:25,666
Are you okay baby? Did you get hurt? - Why are you taking so long? 

1131
01:29:25,791 --> 01:29:27,250
You have to understand that.. 

1132
01:29:27,375 --> 01:29:29,583
For God's sake, you're talking to this piece of crap again. 

1133
01:29:29,666 --> 01:29:31,041
Okay, okay, I am starting. 

1134
01:29:31,083 --> 01:29:32,541
Start now. 

1135
01:29:34,458 --> 01:29:35,875
Good girl. 

1136
01:29:38,041 --> 01:29:39,166
Okay. 

1137
01:29:51,125 --> 01:29:53,583
What is it? - Haven't you learned to share? 

1138
01:29:56,708 --> 01:29:58,166
I want to go to the bathroom. 

1139
01:29:59,916 --> 01:30:01,916
Yes, but we just crossed a sign.. 

1140
01:30:02,041 --> 01:30:04,291
..saying that there isn't a bathroom for the next 30 miles - What? 

1141
01:30:04,833 --> 01:30:06,333
I can't wait that long. 

1142
01:30:06,458 --> 01:30:09,208
Listen, I am not going to stop the car in the middle of the desert. 

1143
01:30:09,625 --> 01:30:11,500
I don't know whether this piece of crap will start up again. 

1144
01:30:11,666 --> 01:30:13,083
Control it for just half an hour. 

1145
01:30:13,458 --> 01:30:15,416
I can't, Akash. 

1146
01:30:16,458 --> 01:30:18,125
Did you let me do it in the water that day? 

1147
01:30:18,291 --> 01:30:20,541
I didn't say that I want to do it in the car. 

1148
01:30:22,083 --> 01:30:24,083
And what is this like.. pee revenge. 

1149
01:30:24,208 --> 01:30:25,916
You didn't let me do it.. so I won't let you do it 

1150
01:30:26,041 --> 01:30:29,041
I need to go means I need to go. - Okay, okay. 

1151
01:30:34,958 --> 01:30:36,625
I can't pee here, Akash? 

1152
01:30:36,708 --> 01:30:38,416
There's not a single tree around. 

1153
01:30:38,875 --> 01:30:40,083
Drive a little further. 

1154
01:30:41,625 --> 01:30:44,750
That's it, you've got two options. 

1155
01:30:45,125 --> 01:30:47,875
Either you get down here, or then wait for half an hour. 

1156
01:30:48,166 --> 01:30:50,250
I won't go searching the entire desert for a tree for you to pee. 

1157
01:30:51,625 --> 01:30:52,833
Fine. 

1158
01:31:02,916 --> 01:31:05,333
Akash. - What? 

1159
01:31:06,208 --> 01:31:07,708
What if there are snakes here? 

1160
01:31:07,833 --> 01:31:09,666
There can't be any snakes here, Kiara. 

1161
01:31:09,875 --> 01:31:12,791
How do you know that? - Well, because it's too bloody hot. 

1162
01:31:12,875 --> 01:31:14,500
And they aren't fools like us, you know. 

1163
01:31:14,625 --> 01:31:17,916
Listen, please come with me. 

1164
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:19,625
If I have to come with you, then why not just pee right here.. 

1165
01:31:19,750 --> 01:31:21,000
..why do you want to go all the way there? 

1166
01:31:21,125 --> 01:31:23,083
Just come please. 

1167
01:31:30,833 --> 01:31:32,041
Let's go. 

1168
01:31:32,708 --> 01:31:34,041
Okay. 

1169
01:31:34,125 --> 01:31:35,541
Okay, okay, stop, stop. 

1170
01:31:35,625 --> 01:31:39,333
Now turn around.. 

1171
01:31:39,916 --> 01:31:41,208
..and close your eyes. 

1172
01:31:41,541 --> 01:31:42,916
Kiara, my back is facing you.. 

1173
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,041
..why should I close my eyes.. - Just do it, quickly. 

1174
01:31:46,291 --> 01:31:48,166
Fine. - Ok, now shut your ears as well. 

1175
01:31:48,291 --> 01:31:49,916
What? - Shut your ears.. 

1176
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:51,916
..and imagine that you're somewhere else. 

1177
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,458
I am feeling shy, Akash.. - Fine, fine. 

1178
01:31:55,083 --> 01:31:56,541
My eyes are closed, so are my ears.. 

1179
01:31:56,666 --> 01:31:58,875
..and I am somewhere else. 

1180
01:31:58,958 --> 01:32:00,541
Okay. 

1181
01:32:06,583 --> 01:32:08,000
Oh shit. 

1182
01:32:09,208 --> 01:32:10,583
Stop! Stop! 

1183
01:32:10,666 --> 01:32:13,791
Stop! Stop! 

1184
01:32:13,875 --> 01:32:19,041
Hey, stop. 

1185
01:32:19,416 --> 01:32:23,291
Oh my God. They took Blush. - Stop. 

1186
01:32:24,291 --> 01:32:25,916
Why did you stop chasing them? 

1187
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:27,125
Why didn't you stop them? 

1188
01:32:27,208 --> 01:32:28,291
Why didn't you stop.. 

1189
01:32:28,416 --> 01:32:29,791
Should I have turned into spiderman, and flown behind them? 

1190
01:32:29,875 --> 01:32:31,916
At least the car would've been here. 

1191
01:32:35,291 --> 01:32:36,791
Blush! 

1192
01:33:14,250 --> 01:33:15,750
Water. 

1193
01:33:32,958 --> 01:33:34,291
Akash. 

1194
01:33:36,291 --> 01:33:37,833
What? - Come. 

1195
01:33:38,125 --> 01:33:39,583
What? 

1196
01:34:32,333 --> 01:34:33,708
Oh my, God. 

1197
01:34:33,958 --> 01:34:35,791
Isn't that the thief's car? - Yes. 

1198
01:34:35,916 --> 01:34:38,875
Oh look, there is Blush. - Oh my Blush. 

1199
01:34:39,166 --> 01:34:40,666
My baby. 

1200
01:34:43,041 --> 01:34:44,916
Where are you going? 

1201
01:34:45,125 --> 01:34:46,625
To get the keys from those thieves. 

1202
01:34:46,750 --> 01:34:48,666
How? Do you even have a plan? 

1203
01:34:49,750 --> 01:34:52,500
I am not going to go inside a shady place like this. 

1204
01:34:53,541 --> 01:34:56,583
But of course, "Mr. Been there but never done it." 

1205
01:34:56,666 --> 01:34:58,791
You know what, you stay here while go in and get the keys. 

1206
01:35:19,916 --> 01:35:21,875
Just come in - But.. 

1207
01:35:25,083 --> 01:35:27,416
Look! There they are. 

1208
01:35:27,541 --> 01:35:29,458
But what if they recognise us? 

1209
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:31,875
Your face was all black, remember? 

1210
01:35:32,791 --> 01:35:35,375
Thanks. - You're welcome. 

1211
01:35:37,875 --> 01:35:40,250
Kiara, you really don't need to do this. 

1212
01:35:40,375 --> 01:35:42,041
In fact, I won't let you do this. 

1213
01:35:42,291 --> 01:35:43,875
I'll think of a different plan, come on. 

1214
01:35:44,291 --> 01:35:45,750
Who said I am doing anything? 

1215
01:35:45,833 --> 01:35:48,041
You're on in five seconds. - Thanks. 

1216
01:35:48,458 --> 01:35:51,208
I mean I am not doing Anything.. you are. 

1217
01:36:04,500 --> 01:36:06,041
Good luck buddy. 

1218
01:36:08,083 --> 01:36:09,291
What do I do? 

1219
01:36:10,541 --> 01:36:12,125
Okay. Fine. 

1220
01:36:27,791 --> 01:36:30,208
"Give me a D." 

1221
01:36:31,416 --> 01:36:34,041
"Give me an I." 

1222
01:36:35,125 --> 01:36:36,666
"Give me a S." 

1223
01:36:38,875 --> 01:36:41,041
"Give me a C." 

1224
01:36:42,916 --> 01:36:46,750
"O." 

1225
01:36:54,333 --> 01:36:57,625
"I am a disco dancer." 

1226
01:36:57,958 --> 01:37:00,833
"I am a disco dancer." 

1227
01:37:01,750 --> 01:37:05,291
"Music is my life." 

1228
01:37:05,416 --> 01:37:08,333
"I'm smitten by this fool." 

1229
01:37:08,458 --> 01:37:10,333
"So dance, sway." 

1230
01:37:10,458 --> 01:37:12,708
"Come dance and sway with me." 

1231
01:37:12,791 --> 01:37:15,750
"I am a disco dancer." 

1232
01:37:16,458 --> 01:37:19,333
"I am a disco dancer." 

1233
01:37:19,916 --> 01:37:25,291
"I am a disco dancer." 

1234
01:37:25,416 --> 01:37:27,458
"Disco dancer." 

1235
01:37:28,958 --> 01:37:30,083
I am coming. 

1236
01:37:30,208 --> 01:37:32,583
Sir, please let me go. - Never. 

1237
01:37:32,708 --> 01:37:34,666
But you don't understand, I have never done this before. 

1238
01:37:34,791 --> 01:37:36,958
Don't worry, I'll be gentle. 

1239
01:37:37,541 --> 01:37:39,000
How do I explain to him? 

1240
01:37:39,083 --> 01:37:41,291
Sir, I am virgin, I've never done this 

1241
01:37:41,416 --> 01:37:42,416
Don't cry. 

1242
01:37:42,541 --> 01:37:43,541
Sir, please, 

1243
01:37:43,666 --> 01:37:44,666
Sir, stop, stop. 

1244
01:37:44,791 --> 01:37:47,333
Be a man. - No. sir, I am not a man, I am not a man. 

1245
01:37:47,458 --> 01:37:48,791
Don't cry like a little girl. 

1246
01:37:48,875 --> 01:37:50,375
I am a girl, sir. 

1247
01:37:50,458 --> 01:37:51,625
Sir, please stop. 

1248
01:37:51,708 --> 01:37:52,708
Sir, please stop. 

1249
01:37:53,416 --> 01:37:55,666
I am done for. 

1250
01:37:55,791 --> 01:37:58,041
I'll be ruined. 

1251
01:37:58,166 --> 01:38:00,375
Yeah, you're mine now. - Sir, I am not yours. 

1252
01:38:00,500 --> 01:38:02,041
Sir, not the room. 

1253
01:38:02,083 --> 01:38:03,625
Not the room. Not the room. 

1254
01:38:03,708 --> 01:38:08,875
Not the room, sir. Sir, for god's sake please leave me 

1255
01:38:35,625 --> 01:38:36,833
Okay. 

1256
01:38:42,208 --> 01:38:43,208
What is it? 

1257
01:38:44,375 --> 01:38:47,833
Room service. - Room service, I didn't order anything. 

1258
01:38:54,833 --> 01:38:57,041
Sir, somebody definitely Ordered some ice. 

1259
01:38:57,083 --> 01:38:59,041
Ice? I didn't order any ice. 

1260
01:38:59,083 --> 01:39:00,541
Who is it, honey? 

1261
01:39:01,750 --> 01:39:06,083
Ice. Did you order ice? - Yes I did. 

1262
01:39:06,708 --> 01:39:08,166
Come. 

1263
01:39:08,375 --> 01:39:09,791
Place it over the table. 

1264
01:39:12,625 --> 01:39:14,208
Yes, sir. 

1265
01:39:15,708 --> 01:39:18,375
He has fallen in love with me. 

1266
01:39:18,750 --> 01:39:21,166
You know, we're crazy about each other. 

1267
01:39:21,291 --> 01:39:23,041
Wow, that's so sweet. 

1268
01:39:23,166 --> 01:39:25,416
I am so happy for you guys. 

1269
01:39:25,541 --> 01:39:26,625
Thanks. 

1270
01:39:26,750 --> 01:39:27,875
That's so sweet. 

1271
01:39:27,958 --> 01:39:30,000
Now John, you promised. 

1272
01:39:30,083 --> 01:39:34,125
Do I have to? - You promised. 

1273
01:39:34,208 --> 01:39:36,208
Alright. Alright. 

1274
01:39:36,375 --> 01:39:38,083
Come on, Shave it all well 

1275
01:39:40,541 --> 01:39:41,708
Oh my, God. 

1276
01:39:41,833 --> 01:39:43,083
How did you manage to send him inside? 

1277
01:39:43,208 --> 01:39:44,583
Well, he has gone in to shave his chest hair 

1278
01:39:44,666 --> 01:39:47,166
I just told him that I hate chest hair.. - Really? 

1279
01:39:47,291 --> 01:39:48,708
Can we discuss this later? 

1280
01:39:48,833 --> 01:39:49,916
Run. 

1281
01:39:50,041 --> 01:39:54,541
"The breeze is blowing slowly now." 

1282
01:39:54,625 --> 01:39:59,125
"The way is opening for us now." 

1283
01:39:59,208 --> 01:40:03,458
"The destination is close." 

1284
01:40:03,666 --> 01:40:08,208
"Like the vast blue sky." 

1285
01:40:08,333 --> 01:40:11,875
"The breeze is blowing slowly now." 

1286
01:40:12,125 --> 01:40:13,375
Oh my, God. Akash, do something. 

1287
01:40:13,500 --> 01:40:14,958
What should I do? You do something. 

1288
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:16,083
They're coming. 

1289
01:40:16,166 --> 01:40:17,375
Do something. Your car has stopped. 

1290
01:40:17,458 --> 01:40:18,583
Speak to her. 

1291
01:40:18,666 --> 01:40:20,041
Blush, all is well. All is well. 

1292
01:40:20,083 --> 01:40:23,041
It has started, it has started. 

1293
01:40:23,083 --> 01:40:25,375
We're not done with you. 

1294
01:40:25,500 --> 01:40:27,041
Wait. 

1295
01:40:31,166 --> 01:40:32,500
Oh, God. 

1296
01:40:34,458 --> 01:40:36,166
That was so much fun. 

1297
01:40:36,250 --> 01:40:38,291
Please. What if something had happened? 

1298
01:40:38,416 --> 01:40:40,041
I could've never faced anyone again. 

1299
01:40:40,083 --> 01:40:42,416
At least your last wish would've been fulfilled. 

1300
01:40:48,541 --> 01:40:50,708
Oh God. 

1301
01:40:58,916 --> 01:41:03,333
"Everybody come and party." 

1302
01:41:03,416 --> 01:41:08,375
"Everybody let's party." 

1303
01:41:15,125 --> 01:41:16,500
Thank you. 

1304
01:41:17,750 --> 01:41:19,041
And I am sorry. 

1305
01:41:19,958 --> 01:41:25,083
I am sorry that.. we made a pact.. 

1306
01:41:28,166 --> 01:41:29,875
..And I almost.. 

1307
01:41:33,375 --> 01:41:38,875
And thank you.. for doing so much.. 

1308
01:41:38,958 --> 01:41:42,375
You too look strange saying sorry. 

1309
01:41:46,041 --> 01:41:48,166
So where are we staying? 

1310
01:41:48,375 --> 01:41:51,125
MGM. Venetian, Bellagio. 

1311
01:41:52,500 --> 01:41:54,625
With just 50 dollars, 

1312
01:41:54,791 --> 01:41:57,041
Let us not get too greedy with raised collars, 

1313
01:41:57,583 --> 01:41:59,708
..staying in a motel is not a sin.. 

1314
01:41:59,833 --> 01:42:03,041
..let's just settle for our very own.. Happy Inn! 

1315
01:42:16,541 --> 01:42:17,958
Wow. 

1316
01:42:19,083 --> 01:42:20,958
This was my dream. 

1317
01:42:21,958 --> 01:42:25,083
To come to Vegas and stay here. 

1318
01:42:26,875 --> 01:42:28,541
Thanks, Akash. 

1319
01:42:29,625 --> 01:42:31,208
You know I never understand.. 

1320
01:42:31,333 --> 01:42:33,041
..when you're serious and when you're joking. 

1321
01:42:39,375 --> 01:42:42,791
In any case, I am not staying here for long. 

1322
01:42:42,958 --> 01:42:44,708
I am going to win a lot of money in the casino.. 

1323
01:42:44,833 --> 01:42:47,625
..and get us a suite in the Venetian. 

1324
01:42:47,750 --> 01:42:50,500
We'll be dancing in a suite tonight, got it. 

1325
01:43:55,833 --> 01:43:57,333
"Our.." 

1326
01:43:57,750 --> 01:44:00,375
"Our story.." - Shave it. 

1327
01:44:00,458 --> 01:44:05,166
"A saga young and old." 

1328
01:44:05,250 --> 01:44:07,125
"Covertly this story has moved ahead." 

1329
01:44:07,250 --> 01:44:10,041
By the way.. you can come without the shirt. 

1330
01:44:11,083 --> 01:44:12,375
I don't mind. 

1331
01:44:12,458 --> 01:44:15,041
"Until you arrived." 

1332
01:44:24,375 --> 01:44:26,166
"Our.." 

1333
01:44:26,291 --> 01:44:28,791
"Our story.." 

1334
01:44:29,166 --> 01:44:33,708
"A saga young and old." 

1335
01:44:33,833 --> 01:44:38,333
"Covertly this story has moved ahead." 

1336
01:44:38,666 --> 01:44:43,875
"It was at a standstill, until you arrived." 

1337
01:44:44,833 --> 01:44:48,666
"Your presence made me realise.." 

1338
01:44:48,750 --> 01:44:51,875
"..that you're my reason to live." 

1339
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:59,916
"And I don't know why.. but I feel good" 

1340
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:04,333
"Your presence made me realise.." 

1341
01:45:04,458 --> 01:45:07,833
"..that every journey turned beautiful." 

1342
01:45:07,958 --> 01:45:12,500
"And I don't know why.. I feel good." 

1343
01:45:37,458 --> 01:45:44,708
"A new direction." 

1344
01:45:45,041 --> 01:45:52,958
"New paths everywhere." 

1345
01:45:53,958 --> 01:46:01,083
"My path ended when I found you." 

1346
01:46:01,583 --> 01:46:08,583
"You were my companion, but you became my destination." 

1347
01:46:09,041 --> 01:46:11,041
"Our.." 

1348
01:46:11,125 --> 01:46:13,541
"Our story.." 

1349
01:46:13,916 --> 01:46:20,083
"The paths decide our fate." 

1350
01:46:21,958 --> 01:46:25,625
"Your presence made me realise.." 

1351
01:46:25,708 --> 01:46:29,791
"..that you're my reason to live." 

1352
01:46:29,875 --> 01:46:35,375
"And I don't know why.. I feel good." 

1353
01:46:37,166 --> 01:46:41,041
"Your presence made me realise.." 

1354
01:46:41,166 --> 01:46:44,791
"..that every journey turned beautiful." 

1355
01:46:44,875 --> 01:46:50,041
"And I don't know why.. I feel good," 

1356
01:47:12,750 --> 01:47:16,416
Kiara, hi. - Peshto. 

1357
01:47:16,750 --> 01:47:18,375
Hi. 

1358
01:47:20,250 --> 01:47:22,083
Hi! 

1359
01:47:23,458 --> 01:47:25,125
You, here? - You, here? - Oh God. 

1360
01:47:25,250 --> 01:47:27,208
Kiara! - Natasha. 

1361
01:47:27,291 --> 01:47:29,208
Akash. - Peshto. 

1362
01:47:29,541 --> 01:47:30,666
How are you? 

1363
01:47:30,750 --> 01:47:31,916
Guess what? 

1364
01:47:32,041 --> 01:47:34,208
I've finally found my Mr. Perfecto. 

1365
01:47:34,375 --> 01:47:36,541
Really! In a week? 

1366
01:47:36,666 --> 01:47:39,166
I met him on the flight, - Yes, but.. 

1367
01:47:39,625 --> 01:47:42,333
You know when something feels right from within.. 

1368
01:47:45,500 --> 01:47:46,791
Yes. 

1369
01:47:46,875 --> 01:47:48,041
Okay, come on. 

1370
01:47:48,125 --> 01:47:49,125
There's a big party upstairs. Let's go. 

1371
01:48:06,041 --> 01:48:08,666
"Come on." 

1372
01:49:38,625 --> 01:49:40,041
You came back? 

1373
01:49:49,416 --> 01:49:52,583
You are drunk Kiara. - Excellent observation. 

1374
01:49:55,083 --> 01:49:59,916
You know, Akash, if I didn't know you.. 

1375
01:50:01,083 --> 01:50:03,958
..I would feel that you were slightly jealous. 

1376
01:50:05,833 --> 01:50:07,750
Because you left so quietly. 

1377
01:50:11,250 --> 01:50:16,958
So.. were you jealous because I was enjoying myself? 

1378
01:50:17,041 --> 01:50:22,416
..or because I was enjoying without you? 

1379
01:50:24,625 --> 01:50:26,625
If you were really enjoying so much.. 

1380
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:29,333
..then why would you be here? 

1381
01:50:29,666 --> 01:50:31,791
How can you be so sure each time? 

1382
01:50:34,916 --> 01:50:36,750
So Logical? 

1383
01:50:37,500 --> 01:50:39,041
So Confident? 

1384
01:50:52,041 --> 01:50:53,416
Go to sleep, Kiara. 

1385
01:50:54,708 --> 01:50:56,208
We've to got to leave early in the morning 

1386
01:50:59,541 --> 01:51:01,583
But we've still got the night. 

1387
01:51:08,750 --> 01:51:10,708
Running away from every situation. 

1388
01:51:12,875 --> 01:51:14,875
There are some things about you that don't change. 

1389
01:51:17,833 --> 01:51:19,708
This isn't funny anymore, Kiara. 

1390
01:51:20,125 --> 01:51:22,291
I never said I was joking. 

1391
01:52:35,416 --> 01:52:36,666
Good morning. 

1392
01:52:42,083 --> 01:52:43,333
Coffee, ma'am. 

1393
01:52:43,416 --> 01:52:45,041
Black, low-fat. 

1394
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:50,208
Are you okay? 

1395
01:52:53,625 --> 01:52:54,958
What's wrong, Kiara? 

1396
01:53:02,750 --> 01:53:09,333
Why do I feel.. that I am cheating on Kunal? 

1397
01:53:15,833 --> 01:53:17,375
Last night.. 

1398
01:53:23,541 --> 01:53:25,500
Why am I feeling so guilty? 

1399
01:53:29,708 --> 01:53:34,583
You know even the other day.. I didn't do anything. 

1400
01:53:35,708 --> 01:53:39,750
I left the bar with that man. 

1401
01:53:52,875 --> 01:53:55,708
"I am sorry.. I can't do this." 

1402
01:53:59,958 --> 01:54:02,875
Akash, I can't do this to Kunal. 

1403
01:54:08,083 --> 01:54:10,833
I have imagined my entire life with him. 

1404
01:54:13,291 --> 01:54:15,333
Since I was three years old. 

1405
01:54:18,958 --> 01:54:23,541
And.. it has always been Kunal, for me. 

1406
01:54:25,833 --> 01:54:32,916
And maybe.. it will always be Kunal. 

1407
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,166
You didn't betray him last night either, Kiara. 

1408
01:54:50,750 --> 01:54:52,375
There is nothing between us. 

1409
01:54:54,166 --> 01:54:56,208
Last night too, nothing happened between us 

1410
01:55:05,541 --> 01:55:08,041
Black, low-fat. 

1411
01:55:12,416 --> 01:55:14,166
I like full fat. 

1412
01:55:15,500 --> 01:55:17,125
You're most welcome. 

1413
01:55:17,958 --> 01:55:19,041
Thanks. 

1414
01:55:23,208 --> 01:55:26,166
Come on, we've to go far. 

1415
01:55:35,083 --> 01:55:41,583
"My eyes are wet as rain, with the sorrow of the pain." 

1416
01:55:42,291 --> 01:55:48,916
"My eyes are wet as rain, with the sorrow of the pain." 

1417
01:55:49,625 --> 01:55:57,833
"The dark nights seem like my companion." 

1418
01:56:00,541 --> 01:56:08,708
"I've nothing left in these deserted paths." 

1419
01:56:09,583 --> 01:56:16,791
I had imagined my entire life with him 

1420
01:56:16,875 --> 01:56:24,250
"I say this every moment to myself." 

1421
01:56:24,375 --> 01:56:27,791
"I've forgotten you." 

1422
01:56:27,916 --> 01:56:31,625
"I've forgotten you." 

1423
01:56:31,916 --> 01:56:35,791
"I've forgotten you." 

1424
01:56:36,041 --> 01:56:38,958
"So then why do your memories.." 

1425
01:56:39,041 --> 01:56:42,458
"Make me cry." 

1426
01:56:42,583 --> 01:56:46,375
"Make me cry." 

1427
01:56:51,208 --> 01:56:58,458
"Your memories still haunt me." 

1428
01:56:58,541 --> 01:57:05,708
"losing my love has left me to complaint" 

1429
01:57:05,958 --> 01:57:09,541
"if he had to separate us then why did he bring us together" 

1430
01:57:09,666 --> 01:57:13,166
"you must have fallen in love too, and lost your love, oh god" 

1431
01:57:13,250 --> 01:57:19,041
"you will understand the pain of separation" 

1432
01:57:20,500 --> 01:57:29,375
"The dark nights seem like my companion." 

1433
01:57:31,541 --> 01:57:40,083
"I've nothing left in these deserted paths." 

1434
01:58:06,125 --> 01:58:08,041
What are we doing in San Francisco? 

1435
01:58:10,333 --> 01:58:12,541
Akash, will you say something? 

1436
01:58:13,333 --> 01:58:14,583
Weren't we going home? 

1437
01:58:14,666 --> 01:58:16,041
Not us.. 

1438
01:58:21,333 --> 01:58:22,458
You are going home. 

1439
01:58:22,541 --> 01:58:23,833
What are you saying? 

1440
01:58:24,583 --> 01:58:26,458
Why were we on that bridge that night, Kiara? 

1441
01:58:26,958 --> 01:58:28,625
What's the point of this discussion? 

1442
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:32,958
Because both of us had lost the one thing we loved the most in life. 

1443
01:58:34,458 --> 01:58:35,666
Think about it Kiara 

1444
01:58:35,833 --> 01:58:38,666
We met on that bridge, our story began from there. 

1445
01:58:39,125 --> 01:58:42,041
But that doesn't mean it has to end there. 

1446
01:58:42,916 --> 01:58:44,541
We tried to die so many times. 

1447
01:58:45,333 --> 01:58:46,708
How many chances did we give death? 

1448
01:58:48,875 --> 01:58:50,041
Five. 

1449
01:58:50,875 --> 01:58:52,083
And life? 

1450
01:58:53,666 --> 01:58:56,041
How many times did we try to solve our problems? 

1451
01:58:56,125 --> 01:58:57,416
Sit down and face them? 

1452
01:59:00,916 --> 01:59:02,041
Not even once. 

1453
01:59:03,166 --> 01:59:04,791
And we say that life's not fair. 

1454
01:59:08,625 --> 01:59:10,916
In these past few days I have learnt that.. 

1455
01:59:12,833 --> 01:59:15,375
..no matter how many reasons you have to die.. 

1456
01:59:19,250 --> 01:59:21,291
..you need just one to live. 

1457
01:59:22,416 --> 01:59:24,166
I found your reason, Kiara. 

1458
01:59:26,041 --> 01:59:28,291
You have a beautiful family, you have Kunal. 

1459
01:59:28,666 --> 01:59:30,375
Everything can go back to what it was. 

1460
01:59:30,583 --> 01:59:32,125
If you just give him a chance. 

1461
01:59:33,333 --> 01:59:34,916
You still love him, Kiara. 

1462
01:59:41,666 --> 01:59:45,833
You're doing all this because I don't love you, Akash. 

1463
01:59:46,708 --> 01:59:48,833
You're very bad at handling rejection. 

1464
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,958
It's not about me, Kiara. - Oh yeah Mr. Hotshot Wall Street guy. 

1465
01:59:52,083 --> 01:59:54,625
You're actually thinking about someone else, wow. 

1466
01:59:55,541 --> 02:00:00,166
Yes, Kiara, maybe I can think about someone else. 

1467
02:00:02,541 --> 02:00:04,625
I'm not saying that Kunal didn't do anything wrong. 

1468
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:07,708
But that's what a mistake means. 

1469
02:00:09,333 --> 02:00:11,125
It is possible for you love someone,, 

1470
02:00:11,250 --> 02:00:12,833
..but make the mistake by straying away with someone else. 

1471
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,041
It could've happened with you too last night. 

1472
02:00:19,166 --> 02:00:20,583
It's possible, Kiara. 

1473
02:00:23,958 --> 02:00:25,125
Go back to him. 

1474
02:00:26,250 --> 02:00:28,416
You know your happiness lies with him. 

1475
02:00:29,916 --> 02:00:31,875
Everything can be just as it was. 

1476
02:00:32,875 --> 02:00:35,833
Where you felt that you're the luckiest girl in the world. 

1477
02:00:36,875 --> 02:00:38,750
There's just a slight change. 

1478
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,083
Now Kunal is the luckiest boy in this world. 

1479
02:00:53,500 --> 02:00:54,625
What is your address? 

1480
02:01:15,958 --> 02:01:17,375
I am sorry, Akash. 

1481
02:01:18,500 --> 02:01:21,958
For all that I said in a fit of rage.. 

1482
02:01:22,958 --> 02:01:24,166
..I didn't mean them. 

1483
02:01:31,208 --> 02:01:34,041
Take Blush with you. 

1484
02:01:36,625 --> 02:01:38,041
Her? 

1485
02:01:39,875 --> 02:01:41,625
But, she only listens to you. 

1486
02:01:46,250 --> 02:01:48,041
She will now start listening to you too. 

1487
02:02:09,041 --> 02:02:11,208
How will I know that you're fine? 

1488
02:02:12,916 --> 02:02:14,625
Where will I call you? 

1489
02:02:18,041 --> 02:02:19,333
You won't have to. 

1490
02:02:22,333 --> 02:02:23,958
I will call you. 

1491
02:02:38,125 --> 02:02:39,458
Aakash. 

1492
02:02:48,666 --> 02:02:55,958
"I separated from you for a while, and my path changed" 

1493
02:02:56,041 --> 02:02:59,583
"I started losing you and I felt something started going away" 

1494
02:02:59,666 --> 02:03:03,083
"my very own was not mine anymore" 

1495
02:03:03,208 --> 02:03:06,666
"You pray for me now." 

1496
02:03:06,833 --> 02:03:10,458
"You relieve me from this pain." 

1497
02:03:10,541 --> 02:03:13,500
"I couldn't be yours." 

1498
02:03:13,583 --> 02:03:16,708
"I say this every moment to myself." 

1499
02:03:16,833 --> 02:03:20,041
"I've forgotten you." 

1500
02:03:20,208 --> 02:03:23,583
"I've forgotten you." 

1501
02:03:23,916 --> 02:03:27,875
"I've forgotten you." 

1502
02:03:28,125 --> 02:03:31,083
"So why did your memories.." 

1503
02:03:31,208 --> 02:03:34,583
"Make me cry." 

1504
02:03:34,708 --> 02:03:38,791
"Make me cry." 

1505
02:03:43,291 --> 02:03:50,583
"Your memories follow me everywhere." 

1506
02:03:50,750 --> 02:03:58,083
"Those forgotten moments ask me why we ever separated." 

1507
02:03:58,208 --> 02:04:01,500
"There's this huge distance between us." 

1508
02:04:01,583 --> 02:04:05,333
"God, you created this distance." 

1509
02:04:05,416 --> 02:04:08,416
"God, what was destined to happen has happened." 

1510
02:04:08,541 --> 02:04:12,500
"What you had written in our fates." 

1511
02:04:14,541 --> 02:04:23,666
"The dark nights seem like my companion." 

1512
02:04:25,333 --> 02:04:33,875
"I've nothing left in these deserted paths." 

1513
02:04:37,333 --> 02:04:39,041
Oh my, God. Akash. 

1514
02:04:39,291 --> 02:04:40,625
Deven, look who is here. 

1515
02:04:41,291 --> 02:04:42,583
Hi. 

1516
02:04:44,833 --> 02:04:45,833
Where did you disappear to? 

1517
02:04:45,916 --> 02:04:47,125
You had everyone worried? 

1518
02:04:47,250 --> 02:04:48,750
Who is it, Sapna? 

1519
02:04:49,250 --> 02:04:51,500
Rohan, stop scattering your toys. 

1520
02:04:51,583 --> 02:04:53,083
Can't you look where you're going? 

1521
02:04:53,250 --> 02:04:54,375
Akash. 

1522
02:04:55,041 --> 02:04:56,083
Dude. 

1523
02:04:58,958 --> 02:05:00,333
Where did you disappear to? 

1524
02:05:00,583 --> 02:05:02,208
You had everyone worried? 

1525
02:05:02,375 --> 02:05:03,541
I got that. 

1526
02:05:03,666 --> 02:05:05,125
Do all married couples say the same line? 

1527
02:05:05,250 --> 02:05:07,708
Very funny, come on in. 

1528
02:05:48,791 --> 02:05:51,458
Kiara. Hi. 

1529
02:05:53,500 --> 02:05:58,416
Hi, I.. I, - Come in, please. 

1530
02:05:58,541 --> 02:06:00,416
No, I should go. 

1531
02:06:00,541 --> 02:06:03,041
Kiara. Come in. 

1532
02:06:08,958 --> 02:06:10,125
I guess it's a sign. 

1533
02:06:15,125 --> 02:06:16,625
Bye, Kunal. 

1534
02:06:17,458 --> 02:06:19,875
Your house is still on the way to my restaurant 

1535
02:06:21,291 --> 02:06:23,500
come on, please let me drop you 

1536
02:06:26,833 --> 02:06:29,083
I am really sorry, Deven. Sapna. 

1537
02:06:31,916 --> 02:06:33,125
It's all my fault. 

1538
02:06:33,625 --> 02:06:36,833
If I wasn't so aggressive.. - Akash, when in good times.. 

1539
02:06:37,041 --> 02:06:38,875
..we all made a lot of profit. 

1540
02:06:40,250 --> 02:06:41,625
Because of you Isn't it? 

1541
02:06:44,708 --> 02:06:46,875
Deven, please explain to him. 

1542
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:48,833
Why do you twist your words so much? 

1543
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:50,625
You men and your speeches. 

1544
02:06:52,250 --> 02:06:54,750
Hello, what's so funny? Why are you smiling? 

1545
02:06:54,916 --> 02:06:56,041
No. nothing. 

1546
02:06:56,833 --> 02:06:57,916
You just reminded me of someone. 

1547
02:06:58,041 --> 02:06:59,125
A girl. 

1548
02:06:59,375 --> 02:07:01,708
Wow, it's finally happened. Who is she? 

1549
02:07:01,833 --> 02:07:03,083
Sapna, stop it. 

1550
02:07:04,583 --> 02:07:06,041
Our world is crashing down here.. 

1551
02:07:06,166 --> 02:07:08,458
..and you girls can only think about romance. 

1552
02:07:10,375 --> 02:07:14,125
Akash, we want to say that.. 

1553
02:07:15,166 --> 02:07:18,958
..we've decided to go back to India. - What? 

1554
02:07:19,291 --> 02:07:23,291
We feel that you should come to India with us 

1555
02:07:23,958 --> 02:07:27,791
Deven.. - No one can attract business like you do. 

1556
02:07:27,916 --> 02:07:29,125
Akash, Deven is right. 

1557
02:07:29,291 --> 02:07:31,208
You guys are just made for each other. 

1558
02:07:32,666 --> 02:07:33,916
Only in business. 

1559
02:07:38,041 --> 02:07:39,083
When are you'll leaving? 

1560
02:07:39,208 --> 02:07:40,375
On the night of 31st. 

1561
02:07:40,541 --> 02:07:42,958
That's when you get the cheapest tickets. - Shut up. 

1562
02:07:49,041 --> 02:07:50,958
Let's go. - What? 

1563
02:07:51,833 --> 02:07:53,125
Let's go. 

1564
02:08:16,625 --> 02:08:18,416
I am really sorry, Kiara. 

1565
02:08:20,458 --> 02:08:21,833
I am really sorry. 

1566
02:08:24,041 --> 02:08:28,041
Can't we start again, please? 

1567
02:08:29,125 --> 02:08:30,416
Can we not start again? 

1568
02:08:37,833 --> 02:08:39,041
As friends? 

1569
02:08:47,083 --> 02:08:49,666
Yeah. As friends. 

1570
02:09:25,250 --> 02:09:26,750
Sorry! 

1571
02:09:39,291 --> 02:09:42,500
"Everything seems faded." 

1572
02:09:42,583 --> 02:09:45,625
"Wonder what's wrong with me." 

1573
02:09:45,708 --> 02:09:50,208
"Everything and everyone looks unfamiliar." 

1574
02:09:51,708 --> 02:09:55,041
"I've a similar grievance." 

1575
02:09:55,083 --> 02:09:58,333
"Everyone I have come across these days" 

1576
02:09:58,416 --> 02:10:02,458
"Seemed unfamiliar." 

1577
02:10:04,333 --> 02:10:07,875
"there is a slight sadness here" 

1578
02:10:07,958 --> 02:10:10,625
"though so close, yet you are unfamiliar" 

1579
02:10:10,708 --> 02:10:15,708
"Though so close yet you're unfamiliar." 

1580
02:10:16,125 --> 02:10:22,375
"Though he was a stranger." 

1581
02:10:22,500 --> 02:10:28,708
"But he was mine." 

1582
02:10:28,791 --> 02:10:32,500
"She might be a stranger." 

1583
02:10:32,583 --> 02:10:41,458
"But she's somewhere around." 

1584
02:10:52,541 --> 02:10:54,166
'Where are your parents now? ' 

1585
02:10:54,375 --> 02:10:56,041
'You didn't even talk to them.' 

1586
02:10:56,625 --> 02:11:00,833
Dad, Akash here. 

1587
02:11:34,541 --> 02:11:40,750
"Since I found out that I'll never get to know you again." 

1588
02:11:40,875 --> 02:11:45,791
"I started keeping away from love." 

1589
02:11:47,083 --> 02:11:53,500
"Since I realised I will never think about you again." 

1590
02:11:53,583 --> 02:11:58,041
"my heart always made some excuse" 

1591
02:11:58,500 --> 02:12:05,291
"Everything we didn't speak about." 

1592
02:12:05,375 --> 02:12:12,083
"Why didn't you ever say them?" 

1593
02:12:12,208 --> 02:12:15,375
"There's so much to say." 

1594
02:12:15,458 --> 02:12:17,458
"Happiness is waiting with arms stretched," 

1595
02:12:17,541 --> 02:12:23,708
"but I can still feel the void" 

1596
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:30,125
"Though he was a stranger." 

1597
02:12:30,541 --> 02:12:35,750
"But he was mine." 

1598
02:12:36,416 --> 02:12:43,041
"She might be a stranger." 

1599
02:12:43,083 --> 02:12:49,708
"But she's somewhere around." 

1600
02:13:06,375 --> 02:13:08,041
You look beautiful, Peshto. 

1601
02:13:09,166 --> 02:13:11,958
Thanks, you look great too. 

1602
02:13:12,291 --> 02:13:13,416
Thank you. 

1603
02:13:14,208 --> 02:13:20,041
You know, he loves you a lot. - Yeah, I know. 

1604
02:13:21,208 --> 02:13:23,041
But he isn't as lucky as Kunal. 

1605
02:13:28,625 --> 02:13:30,333
Who are you talking about? 

1606
02:13:30,458 --> 02:13:31,833
Come on, you girls. 

1607
02:13:40,166 --> 02:13:41,208
31st December. 

1608
02:13:41,375 --> 02:13:44,333
New year night. 12'clock. 

1609
02:13:44,583 --> 02:13:46,208
We will jump from that bridge. 

1610
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:55,791
Attention, guys. 

1611
02:13:55,916 --> 02:13:57,500
To Peshto and Nikhil. 

1612
02:13:58,000 --> 02:13:59,625
The first wedding in our group. 

1613
02:14:00,166 --> 02:14:03,666
Here's wishing you guys a long and happy marriage. 

1614
02:14:04,125 --> 02:14:07,166
And if anybody has any objections, now is the time to say it. 

1615
02:14:07,666 --> 02:14:09,791
Cheers everybody. 

1616
02:14:10,750 --> 02:14:12,708
Wow, super. 

1617
02:14:30,958 --> 02:14:33,041
'Do you believe in signs? ' 

1618
02:14:39,583 --> 02:14:42,083
Your coffee, black. Low fat. 

1619
02:14:45,333 --> 02:14:47,333
'Coffee, low fat.' 

1620
02:14:53,333 --> 02:14:54,500
Who is he? 

1621
02:14:56,625 --> 02:14:57,750
Tell me. 

1622
02:15:02,375 --> 02:15:06,750
I am sure, this time I've lost you forever. 

1623
02:15:08,041 --> 02:15:11,541
And this time, I am not wrong. 

1624
02:15:16,125 --> 02:15:17,541
You're right. 

1625
02:15:17,666 --> 02:15:23,125
So, who is he? - Kunal.. 

1626
02:15:24,541 --> 02:15:26,041
His name isn't Kunal. 

1627
02:15:28,291 --> 02:15:30,458
I don't even know what it is. 

1628
02:15:33,041 --> 02:15:35,458
I have only known him for the past 20 days and it feels like 

1629
02:15:35,583 --> 02:15:37,416
You can never forget him. 

1630
02:15:39,875 --> 02:15:41,666
Yeah! 

1631
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:46,791
And maybe I'll never meet him again. 

1632
02:15:49,791 --> 02:15:52,708
I don't even know where he is. 

1633
02:15:53,750 --> 02:15:55,625
Or where he stays or where he'll be 

1634
02:15:57,583 --> 02:15:59,333
I don't even have his phone number. 

1635
02:16:06,541 --> 02:16:08,041
All I know is that tonight.. 

1636
02:16:08,083 --> 02:16:10,875
..we were supposed to meet in New York. 

1637
02:16:11,875 --> 02:16:13,375
So? 

1638
02:16:14,875 --> 02:16:17,416
So what? - Go. 

1639
02:16:20,041 --> 02:16:22,625
He won't be there. - How can you be so sure? 

1640
02:16:22,708 --> 02:16:24,041
Because.. 

1641
02:16:29,750 --> 02:16:33,500
Oh my, God. Peshto. I am not sure. 

1642
02:16:34,708 --> 02:16:36,375
He could be there. 

1643
02:16:37,166 --> 02:16:38,958
I didn't even think about it. 

1644
02:16:40,125 --> 02:16:41,916
I should go, right? - Yes. 

1645
02:16:42,041 --> 02:16:44,166
But I have to be there by 12 o'clock. 

1646
02:16:44,333 --> 02:16:45,416
What is the time now? - Its 1 o'clock. 

1647
02:16:45,541 --> 02:16:46,666
And what is the time difference in New York. 

1648
02:16:46,750 --> 02:16:48,250
Three hours. 

1649
02:16:48,375 --> 02:16:50,083
There's a flight to New York every hour. 

1650
02:16:53,333 --> 02:16:57,166
I'll take you there. - But, Kunal. 

1651
02:16:58,041 --> 02:16:59,875
Well, what are friends for? 

1652
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:06,041
"You are my sunshine, my sunshine." 

1653
02:17:06,666 --> 02:17:07,791
"You are the only one." 

1654
02:17:07,875 --> 02:17:11,041
You guys are so cute. 

1655
02:17:48,958 --> 02:17:51,625
Kunal, I just want to tell you.. - Just go, Kiara. 

1656
02:17:51,750 --> 02:17:54,250
Get the hell out of here. Its an order. Now. 

1657
02:17:54,375 --> 02:17:56,666
Thanks, Kunal. - Go, go, go. 

1658
02:17:58,666 --> 02:18:00,500
"You are the sunshine." 

1659
02:18:10,833 --> 02:18:12,333
See you. 

1660
02:18:13,250 --> 02:18:15,125
What happened to the house? 

1661
02:18:18,791 --> 02:18:23,291
There's still one hour to go for it to be 12 o'clock. 

1662
02:18:24,291 --> 02:18:26,500
At least go and see whether she's there or not 

1663
02:18:30,291 --> 02:18:34,375
She is happy where she is. 

1664
02:18:56,708 --> 02:18:57,833
Taxi. 

1665
02:19:00,833 --> 02:19:02,333
Towards the Washington bridge please. 

1666
02:19:02,458 --> 02:19:03,666
Make it fast! 

1667
02:19:13,291 --> 02:19:23,916
"God. Is the sun shining somewhere far?" 

1668
02:19:25,500 --> 02:19:35,541
"You and I have found a reason to live again." 

1669
02:19:36,791 --> 02:19:43,000
"If you want we can find our destination again." 

1670
02:19:43,083 --> 02:19:50,000
"Our paths will cross again." 

1671
02:19:50,125 --> 02:20:01,541
"I am running towards where my world is." 

1672
02:20:01,958 --> 02:20:08,541
"Though he was a stranger." 

1673
02:20:08,666 --> 02:20:14,625
"But he was mine." 

1674
02:20:14,750 --> 02:20:21,125
"She might be a stranger." 

1675
02:20:21,250 --> 02:20:28,666
"But she's somewhere around." 

1676
02:20:56,250 --> 02:20:57,541
You're getting married? 

1677
02:21:18,750 --> 02:21:20,041
Why? 

1678
02:21:21,208 --> 02:21:22,416
Are you proposing to me? 

1679
02:21:26,208 --> 02:21:27,375
You? 

1680
02:21:28,625 --> 02:21:32,333
Remember.. I have no interest in you 

1681
02:21:33,958 --> 02:21:35,041
Zilch 

1682
02:21:36,916 --> 02:21:40,375
I don't know if I should be relieved.. 

1683
02:21:40,500 --> 02:21:43,875
..or then begin to wonder why you aren't interested in me? 

1684
02:21:44,416 --> 02:21:46,500
Not that I want you to be interested in me. 

1685
02:21:49,166 --> 02:21:50,333
You know what I mean? 

1686
02:21:51,833 --> 02:21:53,208
Then what are you doing here? 

1687
02:22:00,250 --> 02:22:01,750
You're all dressed up 

1688
02:22:03,833 --> 02:22:06,541
Yeah and I've done my hair too. 

1689
02:22:09,833 --> 02:22:12,583
You do know that we're going to jump into the water? 

1690
02:22:13,708 --> 02:22:16,625
And your hair will get really messed up. 

1691
02:22:17,875 --> 02:22:18,916
Probably. 

1692
02:22:19,041 --> 02:22:20,958
Because jumping from here.. 

1693
02:22:21,041 --> 02:22:23,041
..is like jumping from the 100th floor of a building. 

1694
02:22:23,666 --> 02:22:27,125
Splat! as soon as you land. 

1695
02:22:28,708 --> 02:22:34,791
Do you have a better option? - Yeah, there is another one.. 

1696
02:22:35,291 --> 02:22:37,041
But it's slightly romantic. 

1697
02:22:37,500 --> 02:22:39,333
Instead of jumping from here.. 

1698
02:22:40,125 --> 02:22:42,166
..we could just go down and walk into the water. 

1699
02:22:42,666 --> 02:22:45,208
Oh my, God. Its really cold. 

1700
02:22:46,083 --> 02:22:47,958
Just a little bit longer. 

1701
02:22:48,666 --> 02:22:50,291
And we won't even feel it anymore 

1702
02:22:55,541 --> 02:23:00,083
So.. it was really nice knowing you. 

1703
02:23:04,125 --> 02:23:05,458
Yes, you too. 

1704
02:23:14,250 --> 02:23:16,958
It's cold. - Really. 

1705
02:23:21,541 --> 02:23:23,750
Isn't the moon looking so pretty today? 

1706
02:23:26,541 --> 02:23:29,541
Why are you talking like a girl? 

1707
02:23:30,333 --> 02:23:31,750
Really? - Yes. 

1708
02:23:31,916 --> 02:23:33,083
Oh my, God. Akash, look. 

1709
02:23:33,458 --> 02:23:35,000
What? - That's our bottle. Over there. 

1710
02:23:35,083 --> 02:23:36,125
Where? 

1711
02:23:36,250 --> 02:23:37,875
There. - No, that can't be our bottle. 

1712
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:41,083
Wait, I'll go get it. - Kiara. 

1713
02:23:41,375 --> 02:23:44,041
Our bottle. - Kiara. 

1714
02:23:45,125 --> 02:23:49,000
Kiara. Kiara. - I got it. 

1715
02:23:49,083 --> 02:23:53,250
Are you okay? you okay? 

1716
02:23:53,375 --> 02:23:55,583
Look, this isn't out bottle.. 

1717
02:23:55,708 --> 02:23:57,666
..but there's a note inside this one too 

1718
02:23:59,083 --> 02:24:01,125
Alright. 

1719
02:24:02,166 --> 02:24:05,875
We tried to die together many times.. 

1720
02:24:06,041 --> 02:24:08,041
..and it was so much fun. 

1721
02:24:08,125 --> 02:24:13,625
Just imagine.. how great it would be if we decided to live together. 

1722
02:24:14,041 --> 02:24:16,708
I don't want to think, I just want to live.. 

1723
02:24:16,833 --> 02:24:19,166
..with you. Kiara. 

1724
02:24:21,041 --> 02:24:23,041
Forever and ever. 

1725
02:24:23,375 --> 02:24:24,875
Till the day I die. 

1726
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:26,333
Akash 

1727
02:24:26,458 --> 02:24:28,166
Oh my, God. 

1728
02:24:28,458 --> 02:24:29,875
Akash 

1729
02:24:31,125 --> 02:24:32,333
What is this? 

1730
02:24:32,916 --> 02:24:34,041
Oh my, God. 

1731
02:24:34,208 --> 02:24:36,791
It's a ring. Where did this come from? 

1732
02:24:36,916 --> 02:24:38,041
Finally. 

1733
02:24:40,041 --> 02:24:41,333
Where did you get it from? 

1734
02:24:41,458 --> 02:24:43,375
Kiara, I am proposing to you. 

1735
02:24:43,666 --> 02:24:46,625
Oh, sorry. - Continue. 

1736
02:24:47,041 --> 02:24:48,833
Kiara, will you. 

1737
02:24:52,041 --> 02:24:54,583
Oh my, God. It's you again. 

1738
02:24:54,708 --> 02:24:57,125
Oh no. You dropped the ring. 

1739
02:24:57,250 --> 02:24:58,750
Come on. 

1740
02:24:58,875 --> 02:25:00,875
Come on. 

1741
02:25:02,166 --> 02:25:04,583
Could you dim the light please? 

1742
02:25:04,708 --> 02:25:06,166
You're killing the mood. 

1743
02:25:12,416 --> 02:25:14,916
Akash - So, will you.. 

1744
02:25:17,083 --> 02:25:20,625
Kiara. Kiara. Kiara. 

1745
02:25:21,916 --> 02:25:24,166
Yes, I will. I will. 

1746
02:25:24,291 --> 02:25:25,875
Is it a yes? - Yes. 

1747
02:25:26,916 --> 02:25:28,541
You found the ring? - Yes. 

1748
02:25:28,666 --> 02:25:30,041
And I said yes as well. 

1749
02:25:30,166 --> 02:25:32,041
Then why don't you wear it. 

1750
02:25:32,333 --> 02:25:34,208
Stupid, you are supposed to make me wear it 

1751
02:25:34,333 --> 02:25:36,291
But if you want I can wear it myself. 

1752
02:25:36,416 --> 02:25:38,500
No wait, give me the ring. 

1753
02:25:42,291 --> 02:25:44,166
Your fingers are quite fat. 

1754
02:25:44,625 --> 02:25:45,916
No, they are not. 

1755
02:25:46,041 --> 02:25:48,250
They just tend to swell up when it's cold. 

1756
02:25:48,583 --> 02:25:50,041
Shall we put the ring on the little finger then? 

1757
02:25:50,166 --> 02:25:51,208
Yes. 

1758
02:25:53,833 --> 02:25:55,041
There. 

1759
02:25:55,833 --> 02:25:57,416
Your wish has been fulfilled. 

1760
02:26:00,291 --> 02:26:02,041
Well that's going to happen a little later, if you know what I mean 

1761
02:26:04,041 --> 02:26:05,750
I love you Kiara. 

1762
02:26:07,500 --> 02:26:09,041
I love you. 

1763
02:26:13,875 --> 02:26:20,958
"Close your eyes when you don't see your destination." 

1764
02:26:23,708 --> 02:26:25,875
Are you guys trying to commit suicide in the cold? 

1765
02:26:26,375 --> 02:26:29,708
No, we're getting married. 

1766
02:26:30,416 --> 02:26:31,958
Oh my, God. 

1767
02:26:32,083 --> 02:26:34,291
That is worse than suicide. 

1768
02:26:43,041 --> 02:26:48,333
"You're unaware that God's around." 

1769
02:26:48,875 --> 02:26:54,291
"You're unaware that God's around." 

1770
02:26:55,000 --> 02:27:00,791
"You're unaware that God's around." 

1771
02:27:00,916 --> 02:27:07,041
"You're unaware that God's around." 

1772
02:27:19,958 --> 02:27:22,625
"Take a look at yourself." 

1773
02:27:22,750 --> 02:27:28,625
"Why did you give-in to the situation and give up." 

1774
02:27:28,916 --> 02:27:36,583
"Your courage can change your destiny." 

1775
02:27:36,708 --> 02:27:42,458
"Fill your world with your dreams." 

1776
02:27:42,583 --> 02:27:46,083
"I am always with you." 

1777
02:27:46,250 --> 02:27:49,083
"So what if the sun's setting." 

1778
02:27:49,208 --> 02:27:55,041
"You'll find My threshold when the darkness sets in." 

1779
02:27:55,125 --> 02:28:00,041
"And you'll find new hope there once again." 

1780
02:28:00,750 --> 02:28:06,541
"You're unaware that God's around." 

1781
02:28:06,833 --> 02:28:12,250
"You're unaware that God's around." 

1782
02:28:12,708 --> 02:28:18,625
"You're unaware that God's around." 

1783
02:28:18,875 --> 02:28:24,708
"You're unaware that God's around." 

1784
02:28:28,958 --> 02:28:35,333
"All the marks erases." 

1785
02:28:35,500 --> 02:28:40,791
"Only that doesn't get erased.." 

1786
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:50,791
"Think all the problems as My wish." 

1787
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:57,000
"Wherever you are, I'll always be with you." 

1788
02:28:57,083 --> 02:29:01,375
"I won't go anywhere without you." 

1789
02:29:01,500 --> 02:29:07,875
"You're unaware that God's around." 

1790
02:29:08,208 --> 02:29:14,041
"You're unaware that God's around." 

1791
02:29:14,375 --> 02:29:20,208
"You're unaware that God's around." 

1792
02:29:20,333 --> 02:29:28,208
"You're unaware that God's around." 

1793
02:29:43,208 --> 02:29:46,666
"All the Anjaana's say yeah, yeah, yeah" 

1794
02:29:46,791 --> 02:29:50,083
"All the Anjaani's say yeah, yeah, yeah" 

1795
02:29:50,208 --> 02:29:53,458
"All the Anjaana's say yeah, yeah, yeah" 

1796
02:29:53,583 --> 02:29:57,166
"All the Anjaani's say yeah, yeah, yeah" 

1797
02:29:57,458 --> 02:30:01,333
"I met a boy and his name is Anjaana." 

1798
02:30:02,125 --> 02:30:07,458
"and I found a companion on an unknown path" 

1799
02:30:09,875 --> 02:30:13,458
"I met a girl and her name is Anjaani." 

1800
02:30:14,333 --> 02:30:19,625
"It was an unknown dream but it became my reality." 

1801
02:30:21,125 --> 02:30:24,666
"That's how.. - The story goes." 

1802
02:30:24,791 --> 02:30:28,250
"How did it start.. - No one knows." 

1803
02:30:28,375 --> 02:30:34,541
"Two strangers coincidentally met in a world so big." 

1804
02:30:34,666 --> 02:30:41,208
"Anjaana.. Anjaani.." 

1805
02:30:41,791 --> 02:30:47,708
"Together they spun a story." 

1806
02:30:48,625 --> 02:30:54,041
"Anjaana.. Anjaani.." 

1807
02:30:55,708 --> 02:31:01,041
"Together they spun a story." 

1808
02:31:03,041 --> 02:31:06,583
"All the Anjaana's say yeah, yeah, yeah" 

1809
02:31:06,708 --> 02:31:10,041
"All the Anjaani's say yeah, yeah, yeah" 

1810
02:31:10,166 --> 02:31:11,958
"All the Anjaana's.." 

1811
02:31:12,041 --> 02:31:13,833
"All the Anjaani's say yeah, yeah, yeah" 

1
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,160
I'm Rahul.

2
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm forty.

3
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:49,800
Normally by this age,most people experience something big in life.

4
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,080
I also experienced something big.

5
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,000
I mean, really big.

6
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,280
And that changed my life completely.

7
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:06,840
Actually lets start from the begining

8
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,440
Since childhood i

9
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,880
used to live with my parents
and grand parents.

10
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,120
when l reached to 8 years,
my parents died.

11
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,120
my grand parents grew me up.

12
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,240
when l was a child,
so obviously l was cute.

13
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,520
people used to say while
pulling my cheeks so so sweeettt

14
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,920
and that sweetness was the
business of my grandpa..

15
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,080
y.y sweets merchant.

16
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,640
there were more branches
in mumbai than greenry..

17
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,400
brother?

18
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,080
and my grandpa always poked his
nose in my love life.

19
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:58,160
Sometime l'll get his call,
or sometimes he appears like a toad.

20
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,160
i never got the chance for romance.

21
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:04,400
So the marriage is
totally out of question 

22
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,920
see how sachin is playing.

23
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,080
i believe that my grandpa was
die hard fan of sachin.

24
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,520
but he himseld didn't apply the
die word in his life..

25
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,400
time just passed but he didn't pass..

26
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,600
all my relatives got settled abroad.

27
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,920
and then year 2013..

28
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,600
my grandpa's 100th happy birthday

29
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,040
whole relatives got together again

30
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,520
and my life's 2 tragedies too came

31
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,520
My two friends...
Bobby and saleem...

32
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,200
And you both...
mind your business there..

33
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,000
what's this new mess of you both?

34
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,360
not both of you..
but us..

35
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,200
its grandpa's birthday ,
but we brought the gift for you.

36
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,520

37
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,480

38
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,560

39
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,480

allow me for one week.

00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,120

359
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:11,040
Mina was convincing appa emotionally

360
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,920

361
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,280

362
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:21,960
l'm unable to understand
anything like you people.

363
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,400
after seeing this kinda reaction

364
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,160
one thing was clear.

365
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:45,400
after a while, my head won't shake,
but will get cutted.

366
00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:00,360
what your father is saying about my mother?

367
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:05,160
he's asking that ,
do you know tamil language.

368
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,160
i thought l'm gonna go
on four arms.

369
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:40,360
but your father's men
raised me on their shoulders

370
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,600
what did you say to them?

371
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,280
i just lied thrice.

372
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:43,720

373
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,960
Hey, miss subtitle just tell me what you said?

Second time i lied that we
want to get married

376
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,600

379
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,160
no

380
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,880
the plan worked when l lied
third time..

381
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:06,720

382
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:09,320

sine your child hood.

383
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,280
therefore you dont know tamil

384
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,760
appa seems my story is very geniune.

385
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,480
therefore he's taking us to village
for deciding our future.

386
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:22,400
not decided the future but
taking to ruining my future.

387
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:29,280
four people were running

388
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:32,240

389
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:35,000
i just created this drama

393
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,560
to see the small family of mina..

394
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,120
i got reminded of china's population

395
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,040
mina started to recite the
chennai express's story

396
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,040
as much the story got progressed.

397
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,080
everybody were impressed by me

398
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,480
but l was depressed.

399
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,920
there was stress in mind.

400
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,320
because on the address l had come

401
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:47,200
the environment was dangerous.

402
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,160
everybody was involved in my serving.

403
00:38:56,360 --> 00:39:00,400
but this treatment is also for
the victim

404
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:11,360
many times l said to bobby,
take the fancy number.

405
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:15,200
to the person's number l was
trying to contact.

406
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:18,640
those all were vanished from
my brains pane.

407
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:22,760
mobile's this technology gets
us connect with our mom and sis..

408
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:26,160
but this technology screwed us too

that we run away

794
01:38:22,840 --> 01:38:26,440

mina is yours.

920
02:14:47,600 --> 02:14:52,720
he's saying to you've proved
that you'll take care of me forever

921
02:14:52,880 --> 02:14:58,400
its their believe whoever complete
this the god will keep them together

922
02:15:36,600 --> 02:15:39,600
do you love me so much?

923
02:15:45,400 --> 02:15:48,800
so you should get me away
from rameshwaram,

924
02:15:48,960 --> 02:15:52,720
why you took the risk to come here.

925
02:16:06,400 --> 02:16:11,040
now whatever l'll ask you..
will you shake your head?

926
02:16:14,440 --> 02:16:18,800

927
02:16:30,040 --> 02:16:32,960
will you marry me?

928
02:16:38,320 --> 02:16:42,840
will you kick me thinking me as
your father's scooter?

929
02:17:00,320 --> 02:17:04,600
its saying, there's 1635 languages
in india..

930
02:17:05,560 --> 02:17:07,000
now i came to know

931
02:17:07,160 --> 02:17:09,240
the main language is..

932
02:17:09,440 --> 02:17:11,840
love's..

933
02:17:13,880 --> 02:17:19,000
l'm giving the credit to make the hero
of kumban to my grandpa.

934
02:17:20,520 --> 02:17:22,520
he gave me wakeup call when....

935
02:17:22,680 --> 02:17:25,880
l was immersing his ashes..

936
02:17:27,720 --> 02:17:31,560
an wrong train showed me right place.

937
02:17:32,360 --> 02:17:36,200
and today this rahul will
say to mina

1
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:12,199
All is here for the vacancy
to the quality department.

2
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,139
Have you worked somewhere earlier?

3
00:02:28,114 --> 00:02:29,149
Do you want to hear a joke?

4
00:02:30,383 --> 00:02:32,226
Once a man was
drowning in the river.

5
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:37,092
He yelled,
"Lord Ganesha, please save me!"

6
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,602
Lord Ganesha started dancing.

7
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:41,502
The man asked,
"Why are You dancing?"

8
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:46,010
So, Lord Ganesha said, "Didn't you
dance while immersing me in water?"

9
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:52,675
Actually, I shouldn't be cracking
jokes about God in front of God.

10
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:55,481
I'm sorry.
Don't mind, but I have no mind.

11
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:57,112
Give my ball.

12
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:01,591
Hurry up! Quick.

00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:03,252
Kids, are you okay?

Hello. Yes, you.

16
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:19,141
Aren't there enough
potholes in the city..

17
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,405
“that you've dug up another one?

18
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:21,968
And for the past two weeks.

19
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,706
Those kids and my
God were saved today.

20
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:28,611
Why are you so irresponsible?

21
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:30,154
The next time,
someone might lose his life...

22
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,621
...because of these potholes.

23
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:34,520
But whether someone lives or dies...

24
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:36,117
...it doesn't matter to you.

25
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:37,354
Don't worry, madam.

26
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,230
You'll have no complaints
against us henceforth.

27
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:41,026
Okay.

28
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:42,589
Let's see.

29
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:45,658
I-Ii!

30
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:48,969
I just wanted to send
this message across that...

31
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:50,738
...I'm proud of you.

32
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:57,081
I'm sure that whatever you
do in life will be right for you.

33
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:00,315
No matter how many
obstacles you face...

34
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:03,014
...there won't be darkness anymore.

35
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:22,562
Hello.

36
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:24,472
Do you want to listen to the
bad news first or the worst news?

37
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:27,134
The bad news is that you'll
have to live without me every day...

38
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,975
...between 9 to 5 from now on.

39
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:31,009
And the worst news
is that I won't be able...

40
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,981
...to live without you
every day between 9 to 5.

41
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,548
I got the job, Aisha.

42
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:37,477
I got the job.

43
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:41,250
Now go and erase that
wish from your diary.

44
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:43,318
I've become independent.

45
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:44,721
Guru...

46
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:48,093
...there's something
that I have to say to you.

47
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:49,727
Tell me.

48
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,226
No, come home first.

49
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,238
Tell me. I'm on my way home.

50
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,671
No, come home.

51
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:58,502
Hello.

52
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:01,210
How did you get in?

53
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:02,237
Aisha?

54
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:04,045
What are you doing?

55
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:04,677
Who is“

56
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:06,944
Does anyone barge into someone's house
like that without ringing the bell!

57
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:08,314
Get out of here. Get out!

58
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,089
Aisha, who is it? What happened?

59
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:14,986
Aisha!

60
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:16,449
Aisha, who is it?

61
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:19,124
Aisha, listen to me! Police!

62
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:21,689
Aisha! Listen! Hey! - Guru!

63
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:24,501
Listen, you've enmity with me.

64
00:05:24,557 --> 00:05:27,197
Look.. spare her.

65
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:31,640
You have a problem with me.
Listen. Spare her.

66
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:34,076
Guru!
- Hey, stop. Let my Aisha go!

67
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,242
Please! No!

68
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:51,019
Please don't kill me.

69
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:59,966
Please don't kill me. Please.

70
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:27,653
Who is in charge of this area?

71
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,516
I am. Inspector Waghle.

72
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:31,986
Aditya Rathore, CBI.

73
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:36,131
But why is the CBI so keen
on the murder of an ordinary girl?

74
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:41,367
lam keen not on this girl,
but her love.

75
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:43,234
I didn't get you.

76
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:47,040
We'll have to find Aisha's
murderer at the earliest.

77
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:49,303
If he sets out to look for him...

78
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:52,481
...then the government will
have to find some new property.

79
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,710
Guru will kill so many...

80
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:58,449
...that there won't be enough
place to cremate the bodies.

81
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:09,627
'Devil. Monster. Demon. Beast.'

82
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,602
'Who says that only
God has several names?'

83
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,974
'Demons are found in hell.'

84
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:21,443
'But I met one such demon
in the so-called paradise in Goa.'

85
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:26,951
'But demons possess
a special quality.'

86
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,453
'It's his habit to be
present at his own funeral.'

87
00:08:31,143 --> 00:08:32,645
'Hatred is his weapon.'

88
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,215
'Anger is his explosive.'

89
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:37,457
'He doesn't know
what sympathy means.'

90
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,496
'No one loves him.'

91
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:42,399
'Every love story has a hero...'

92
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:43,966
...a heroine...'

93
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:45,258
'...and a villain.'

94
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:52,467
'But this love story
is of a villain.'

95
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:58,039
Please forgive me, Guru.

96
00:08:58,404 --> 00:08:59,712
I made a mistake, Guru.

97
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:02,316
What are you doing?

98
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,487
Guru, please forgive me.

99
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,923
I beg of you, Gurul Please spare me.

100
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,982
I beg of you. Don't do this!
For God's sake, spare me life.

101
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,394
Are you Pfﬂymg?

102
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:14,929
Guru, please forgive me.

103
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:17,365
Do you really think that
He will appear to save you?

104
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:24,238
Fine.

105
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:28,109
Pray.

106
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:30,208
No! Guru.

107
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:34,043
You have time until
this matchstick is put out.

108
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:37,180
Remember your God.

109
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:37,687
Rohan

110
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,490
What are you doing? What happened?

111
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:42,048
What are you doing, son?

112
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:43,324
Rohan.

113
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:45,020
Rohan.

114
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:48,031
Mother, I'll kill him!
- Don't do this!

115
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,124
Please stop.

116
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:52,601
CBI People beat me up a lot.

117
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:55,297
Raghu. Please save me, o God.

118
00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:57,173
Rahull Rahul, no.

119
00:09:57,229 --> 00:09:58,037
Help.

120
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:58,973
Can I give you a suggestion?

121
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,400
Don't pray to God.

122
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:03,277
Pray to the breeze.

123
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:07,541
Because if there's breeze,
you'll be finished.

124
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:12,078
No, no! Guru, please...
I made a mistake.

125
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:13,680
No, no! Guru, what are you doing?

126
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:16,220
Guru, please don't do this!
I beg of you!

127
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,353
No, Guru! Guru...

128
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,523
No, Rohan.
- No, leave me.

129
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:25,091
Guru!

130
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:27,296
Spare me, Guru.

131
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,307
Guru! Guru! No.

132
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:31,603
Guru! Spare me, Guru.

133
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:33,735
Spare me. Guru.

134
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,972
Let go of me!
- Let go off.

135
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:38,406
Guru, no.

136
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,747
Let go of me! Guru, let go of rne!

137
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,308
Please let go of rne!

138
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,719
Fine. I'll let go of you!

139
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:50,151
Brother.

140
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:54,730
No! No!

141
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:05,407
No!

142
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:07,410
No!

143
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,677
Come out.

144
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,613
Come on! Take him out.

145
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,682
Will you kill him? Leave.

146
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:25,026
Come on.

147
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:39,167
Tell me! Who is your boss!

148
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:41,302
Who do you work for!

149
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,404
Has Singh sir sent you?

150
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:46,507
Torture him.
Tell me about his business.

151
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:49,382
Hold him light.
All of you will be punished.

152
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:51,714
Hey, tell me.

153
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:54,285
Come on.

154
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:07,701
Ready, steady, smile!

155
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,967
Okay. A joke.

156
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:12,475
A woman went to the police
station and asked the inspector...

157
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:15,512
"Inspector,
my husband had gone to the market..."

158
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:16,546
"...to buy okra two days ago."

159
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:18,172
"He hasn't come back yet."

160
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:21,184
The inspector said,
"What's the big deal, madam?"

161
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,686
"Cook some other vegetable."

162
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:28,554
Wonderful! - Thank you.

163
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,460
Hey, come on.

164
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:34,657
What is the press doing outside?

165
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:37,664
So that your photos are
published in the newspaper...

166
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:40,670
...and people come to know
that you are the officer...

167
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:44,333
...who forbade an adult girl from
getting married against her will.

168
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:46,706
You're interfering in other people's
lives! Don't you have any shame?

169
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,040
Sheela is an adult.

170
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:50,476
And she came to me for help.

171
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:53,410
All of you treat her like a maid...

172
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:55,076
...who is only supposed
to do the household chores...

173
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:56,449
...and look after children.

174
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:58,284
When she demands to be happy...

175
00:12:58,344 --> 00:13:00,153
...all of you have a problem with it.

176
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:03,050
While trying to belong
to a particular religion...

177
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:05,052
...you have forgotten
to be a human being.

178
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:07,694
Get aside. Move“ move.

179
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:08,697
Out. out from here.

180
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:11,227
Sharad, drive her out.

181
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:31,078
Because of your boss Caesar,
three officers of mine were killed.

182
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:35,387
The officers that
were doing their duty.

183
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:41,726
But I give you a chance.

184
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:44,695
I will make you my pet dog.

185
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:48,562
I will ask Deepu's
mother to testify...

186
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:53,167
...that her son accidentally
fell in the fire in a drunken state.

187
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,501
And being my pet dog...

188
00:13:56,468 --> 00:14:00,507
...you will wag your tail
and take me to your boss Caesar.

189
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,346
It's your decision now.

190
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:06,623
You changed sides, didn't you?

191
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:10,959
She didn't testify against me.

192
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,094
That's the reason
why you're barking!

193
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:16,628
Will you speak up?

194
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:20,935
I will avenge Caesar for
killing my men at any cost.

195
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:24,667
I will make your condition
so miserable in prison...

196
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:27,277
...that you'll yearn for death.

197
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,609
People fear death.

198
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:33,109
But I face death each day.

199
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:36,017
As an uninvited guest.

200
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:38,254
Acting over smart.

201
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:44,559
You'll pay the price
for this insanity, Guru.

202
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,462
This is not insanity. It's manhood.

203
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:55,161
Lawyer, give the bail paper quickly.

204
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:08,474
Arjun.

205
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,348
ls everything alright?

206
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:14,650
Hey, listen!

207
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:17,159
Hey! Do you want to hear a joke?

208
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:19,560
Once a thief got
into a house to steal.

209
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:23,028
The safe read, "There is
no need to break open this safe."

210
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:25,034
"Press 1,2,3 and then the red button."

211
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,364
"The safe will open."

212
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:28,437
As soon as the thief
pressed the button...

213
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:30,565
...the alarm rang and
the police came there.

214
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:33,235
While leaving,
the thief told the owner...

215
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:35,643
"l have lost faith
in humanity today."

216
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:39,511
Hey!

217
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:42,574
The joke was not that bad.

218
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:44,385
You could have at least smiled.

219
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:47,623
Listen. I need you
to do something for me.

220
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,590
You don't have to rob a safe.

221
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:51,559
Someone needs to be kidnapped.

222
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:52,459
Will you do it?

223
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:55,996
I'm not asking you
to do it for free.

224
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:57,090
I'll pay You-

225
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:58,499
Show me your rate card.

226
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:00,195
I would have done it myself.

227
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,496
But just as we go
to a saloon to shave...

228
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:04,199
...and to a tailor
to get clothes stitched...

229
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:06,504
...similarly, won't we go
to a goon to get someone kidnapped?

230
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,442
Because you look like a villain.

231
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:18,647
Hey, villain!

232
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:22,321
Smile!

233
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:28,589
Come on.

234
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:31,294
Sahiba! Guru!

235
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:32,961
Wait. wait.

236
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:37,698
Pass the ball. Quick.

237
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,135
I sent you thereto kill.

238
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,338
Not to get killed.

239
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:51,553
I know that you're
not too fond of living.

240
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:56,059
But your life is priceless for me.
Priceless.

241
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,493
God blessed me with you.

242
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:02,598
You're my son.

243
00:17:02,654 --> 00:17:05,157
You mean more than a son to me.

244
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:09,562
Stop looking for excuses to die.

245
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:11,437
Look for a reason to live.

246
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:12,976
Caesar.

247
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,534
Caesar.

248
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,511
Caesar.

249
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:17,478
I know him.

250
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:18,914
You're too much.

251
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:19,681
Don't you understand?

252
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:20,307
Hey!

253
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:21,214
How many times do I tell you?

254
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:22,115
Hey, villain!

255
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:23,016
Madam, you can't go in.

256
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:24,679
I know him. Let me go.

257
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:26,412
Hey, villain!

258
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:30,225
Yes! See, I told you I know him.

259
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:30,692
I-Ii!

260
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:32,586
As all of you already know...

261
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:36,121
...Mr. Caesar has done
a lot for the people.

262
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:37,394
Villain!

263
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:40,136
I'll scream even louder
if you don't come here.

264
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:42,563
Hey! Come here!

265
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:44,437
Yes. See, he's coming.

266
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,300
I told you...

267
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:49,574
Let go of my hand!
Why are you holding my hand?

268
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:53,474
You have no idea
what I can do to you.

269
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:57,487
It won't take me too
long to dispose your body.

270
00:17:58,143 --> 00:18:01,283
Slop following me and leave.

271
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,499
Wow!

272
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:15,000
This is why I want to hire you.

273
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:19,974
I know you're not the romantic kind.

274
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:22,671
You're the kind that
would shoot someone on sight.

275
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:24,173
Get lost!

276
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:29,245
I'm sorry. Cool it.

277
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:31,686
Listen. You'll kill me...

278
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,683
...and unnecessarily and
go to prison free of cost.

279
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:35,184
The way I'm paying you,
if someone had paid you...

280
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:37,454
...to kill me, then it was worth it.

281
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:39,587
But who would pay to kill me?
I'm so cute.

282
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:41,324
Do you suffer from
a talking disorder?

283
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:43,366
I suffer from a lot of disorders.
Forget about that.

284
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:46,096
Tell me. Will you do it for me?

285
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:47,965
Please say yes.

286
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:50,370
Never refuse money.

287
00:18:57,703 --> 00:19:00,411
We're going on such
an important mission...

288
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:03,009
...but we don't even
know each other's names.

289
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:03,644
I'm Aisha.

290
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:06,888
Guru.

291
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:10,893
Why are you so rude?

292
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,054
Just as it's compulsory
for Superman to wear...

293
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:14,597
...red underwear over his costume...

294
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:17,065
...is it compulsory
for gangsters to be rude?

295
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:19,199
You don't laugh or smile.

296
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:20,965
You don't even shave or bathe.

297
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:23,929
I know what you are.

298
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:25,936
Angry bird.

299
00:19:26,231 --> 00:19:28,211
The game is inspired by you. Yes.

300
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:34,106
Like this“

301
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,244
Are you crazy or the one
who has to be kidnapped is crazy?

302
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:37,616
I'm not crazy.

303
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:40,422
It's Chhotu who's crazy,
just like a depressed lover.

304
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:43,085
That's why his family
got him admitted here.

305
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:45,185
They left him alone
and are settled in America.

306
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,524
Do you know what
they told the doctor?

307
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:47,655
That he's insane.

308
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,557
If I don't help him,
then he'll really go insane.

309
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:52,365
That's why...

310
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:54,570
We'll have to save him.

311
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:01,305
These are coins.
- Yes.

312
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,070
Do you want to hear a joke?

313
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:05,513
Let it be.
- Once... - I'll take the coins.

314
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:10,412
By the way,
you'll have to fight a few people.

315
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,655
You might get hurt.

316
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,250
If it was dancing,
I would have gone to a dancer.

317
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:19,222
But it's action.
That's why I had to come to you.

318
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:22,327
Because you are“ a villain!

319
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:27,366
Hey! Stop!

320
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:27,733
I'm stuck up here.

321
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:31,007
Each day should be like that.
This is fun.

322
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:33,607
Sometimes the players win,
and sometimes they lose.

323
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,544
But the dealer is always profiting.

324
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:55,655
Who are you?

325
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,332
I'm your father by relation.

326
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:05,636
My name is Shehanshah.

327
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:07,699
Shehanshah.

328
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:17,986
Where's Chhotu?

329
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:19,983
Where's Chhotu?

330
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:27,996
Chhotu, come with me.

331
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:31,028
Come on, Chhotu.

332
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:36,301
Chhotu!
- Aisha! Aisha! Aisha!

333
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:38,539
You're getting married, Chhotu!

334
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:40,076
Really?
- Yes!

335
00:21:40,098 --> 00:21:42,271
Chhotu is going to get married.

336
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:44,369
Chhotu is going to get married.

337
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:49,185
"My life is in search
of its destination."

338
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:52,984
"ls this my destination?"

339
00:21:53,278 --> 00:22:01,026
"Why does my heart
say that I must halt here?"

340
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:04,966
"l have found new emotions."

341
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:08,596
"What kind of an effect is this?"

342
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:13,009
"I've found hope again."

343
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:16,706
"Someone has accepted it."

344
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:19,709
Where are you going, son?

345
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:21,580
Stay till the wedding.

346
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:24,180
I didn't even get
the chance to thank you.

347
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:32,688
"Like the poem of a poet..."

348
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:36,722
"...that calms one's mind."

349
00:22:36,788 --> 00:22:40,668
"I've found someone -.

350
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:44,196
"...just as a wanderer
finds shelter."

351
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:48,507
"Like the arrival of a new season."

352
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:52,174
"Or afternoons in winter."

353
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:56,619
"I've found someone -.

354
00:22:56,675 --> 00:23:00,088
"...just as a wanderer
finds shelter."

355
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:17,265
Sorry.

356
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:22,038
Did she kidnap all of them?

357
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:23,475
No.

358
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:24,639
'Blessing your name.'

359
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:25,681
In fact, she has helped them.

360
00:23:26,004 --> 00:23:27,039
'Where the..'

361
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:29,483
Being her father,
I couldn't get her married.

362
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:31,345
But just wait and watch.

363
00:23:31,676 --> 00:23:34,213
She will get all
of them married today.

364
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:55,168
"Just as a shore..."

365
00:23:56,168 --> 00:23:59,240
"...helps a person relax."

366
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:05,516
"I've found her at
a juncture in life."

367
00:24:08,146 --> 00:24:11,218
"Just as a star in the sky..."

368
00:24:11,716 --> 00:24:14,993
"...spreads light."

369
00:24:15,053 --> 00:24:21,334
"She spreads light in the city."

370
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:27,070
"I've forgotten my sorrow."

371
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:30,705
"What kind of an effect is this?"

372
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:37,945
"She is teaching me to live again."

373
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:43,688
"Just as the rains spread joy..."

374
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:47,423
"...or an ointment soothes the pain."

375
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:51,694
"I've found someone -.

376
00:24:51,756 --> 00:24:55,260
"...just as a wanderer
finds shelter."

377
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:59,642
"Like the arrival of a new season."

378
00:24:59,698 --> 00:25:03,168
"Or afternoons in winter."

379
00:25:03,735 --> 00:25:07,615
"I've found someone -.

380
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:11,142
"...just as a wanderer
finds shelter." - Smile.

381
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,396
Mister!

382
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:23,455
Yes, madam.

383
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:24,557
The wedding is today.

384
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:26,198
Please hurry up.

385
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:27,202
Yes, I'm doing it.

386
00:25:43,141 --> 00:25:44,347
Ouch!

387
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:50,189
"The smiling face..."

388
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:54,353
'...acts as a shield."

389
00:25:54,419 --> 00:26:00,392
"l wonder what's
hidden in the heart."

390
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:10,279
"She shadows the others..."

391
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:16,911
"...while she stands under the sun."

392
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:21,247
"She is hurt..."

393
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:26,126
"...but why do I feel the pain?"

394
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:33,333
"What does my heart intend to do?"

395
00:26:35,193 --> 00:26:38,504
"l was like a restless bird."

396
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:43,101
"l was wandering."

397
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:47,014
"I've found someone -.

398
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:50,417
"...just as a wanderer
finds shelter."

399
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:54,980
"Like the arrival of a new season."

400
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:58,516
"Or afternoons in winter."

401
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:02,657
"I've found someone -.

402
00:27:02,988 --> 00:27:06,629
"...just as a wanderer
finds shelter."

403
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:10,605
"Just as a wanderer finds shelter."

404
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:14,633
"Just as a wanderer finds shelter."

405
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:18,476
"Just as a wanderer finds shelter."

406
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:22,285
Uniting two lovers.

407
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:23,579
Aren't there any wishes for her?

408
00:27:24,042 --> 00:27:26,147
There are. Of course.

409
00:27:26,211 --> 00:27:27,986
But all her wishes are really weird.

410
00:27:28,446 --> 00:27:31,393
Seeing a peacock dancing
in the first rain.

411
00:27:31,449 --> 00:27:33,588
To fly like a wind.

412
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,097
Flying like the wind.

413
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:39,964
Catching a butterfly
and playing with it.

414
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:42,335
Touching the snow.

415
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:46,206
Being famous for a day so
that people know who this girl is.

416
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:49,711
Seeing the world under the sea.

417
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:51,975
It gets serious now.

418
00:27:52,303 --> 00:27:56,445
And that is, to save someone's life.

419
00:27:57,242 --> 00:27:58,619
Saving someone's life.

420
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:01,283
Guru, saving someone's life.

421
00:28:19,631 --> 00:28:21,269
Uncle, carefully.

422
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:25,271
We're going to the graveyard.

423
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:46,533
She directly went to
the hospital from church.

424
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:09,384
Thank you, Guru.

425
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:12,050
For the coins that I gave you...

426
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:14,961
...you did much more for
Sheela and Chhotu than that.

427
00:29:15,453 --> 00:29:17,296
No matter how you look...

428
00:29:17,355 --> 00:29:20,427
...you're not such a bad villain
as you try to show the world.

429
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:22,199
You have some good qualities.

430
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,568
Much more than the bad qualities.

431
00:29:23,628 --> 00:29:25,938
I'm not good! I'm very bad!

432
00:29:26,531 --> 00:29:27,566
What do you think of yourself?

433
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:30,673
Do you think we live lo fulfill
your wishes in your diary? - No.

434
00:29:30,735 --> 00:29:31,611
You click everyone's pictures...

435
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:33,080
...to show that you're
a very nice person?

436
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:33,616
No.

437
00:29:33,671 --> 00:29:35,651
What do you try to prove
by cracking jokes every time?

438
00:29:36,741 --> 00:29:38,652
Look at that. Look at death.

439
00:29:39,544 --> 00:29:40,579
Do you want to make fun of it?

440
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:43,217
Crack a joke on it! Come on!

441
00:29:48,553 --> 00:29:51,124
Life is playing the
biggest prank on me.

442
00:29:52,757 --> 00:29:55,533
The biggest joke is that
death is laughing at me.

443
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:58,038
Yes, Guru.

444
00:30:00,031 --> 00:30:01,203
I'm going to die.

445
00:30:03,201 --> 00:30:08,241
These wishes that I want
to fulfill are my last wishes.

446
00:30:09,274 --> 00:30:13,586
I don't even know if I'll be able
to fulfill all of them before dying.

447
00:30:15,213 --> 00:30:16,055
I just...

448
00:30:18,216 --> 00:30:22,130
...want to live my life
like such a party that...

449
00:30:23,054 --> 00:30:24,328
...when death arrives...

450
00:30:24,689 --> 00:30:29,297
...l want to sit and have a couple
of drinks with it before leaving.

451
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:46,281
It was very unfortunate, wasn't it?

452
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:51,057
But if you befriend the devil...

453
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:54,257
...it's bound to knock
on your door someday.

454
00:30:56,087 --> 00:30:57,998
Your Caesar killed your Aisha.

455
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:00,127
But what will you do now?

456
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:01,698
How will you kill Caesar?

457
00:31:02,393 --> 00:31:04,339
No. Let it be.
You won't be able to do it.

458
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:07,168
The one who taught you to shoot...

459
00:31:07,732 --> 00:31:08,608
You will never kill him.

460
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:11,711
Let me do a favour on you.

461
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:13,982
I'll kill him.

462
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:15,645
I'll take your revenge.

463
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:17,311
I'll find him.

464
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:20,515
No matter where he is.

465
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:49,280
Where were you?

466
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:51,414
I called you so many times.

467
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:52,744
I even left a message.

468
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:54,588
Who were you having fun with?

469
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:56,289
Tell me.

470
00:32:03,187 --> 00:32:04,359
It was dead.

471
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:06,528
My phone's battery.

472
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,571
Your phone's battery was dead.

473
00:32:08,626 --> 00:32:10,105
But you were alive, weren't you?

474
00:32:10,161 --> 00:32:11,435
You could have called
from a public phone...

475
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:12,497
...and informed that you'd be late.

476
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:16,008
But no. You will never change.

477
00:32:16,367 --> 00:32:17,971
It's no use telling you anything.
- Listen.

478
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:20,607
Look,
I've brought a chain for you.

479
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:22,577
It'll look pretty on you.

480
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:34,158
Look at this. You brought
bangles for me last week.

481
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:36,623
They've turned black
in just one week.

482
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:40,561
I had gone to aunt Madhvi's
house for a wedding.

483
00:32:42,093 --> 00:32:44,437
I was flaunting these to everyone
saying that these are gold bangles.

484
00:32:45,163 --> 00:32:47,234
But then I realised that
it's not gold, but brass.

485
00:32:47,732 --> 00:32:49,678
It's brass coated with fake gold!

486
00:32:50,401 --> 00:32:51,345
Here are your bangles.

487
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:54,241
You wear these bangles!

488
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:56,979
You and those bangles,
both are a fake!

489
00:32:58,042 --> 00:33:00,044
I just don't want to talk to you.

490
00:33:00,378 --> 00:33:01,948
You will not stay
in this house today.

491
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:03,117
Get out of my house!

492
00:33:03,181 --> 00:33:04,159
Just get out!

493
00:33:04,215 --> 00:33:06,024
Listen to <i>me...</i>
- I said get out!

494
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:07,358
Sulu!

495
00:33:07,418 --> 00:33:11,264
I really don't know how he was born.

496
00:33:13,024 --> 00:33:17,495
Get out of my house.
- Sulu, listen to me.

497
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:19,535
Take this. come on.

498
00:33:19,597 --> 00:33:20,974
Listen to <i>me...</i> - Get out!

499
00:33:21,032 --> 00:33:21,476
<i>Sum.</i>

500
00:33:21,532 --> 00:33:22,510
Get out of here!

501
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:23,939
Listen to me.

502
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:35,220
Father.

503
00:33:45,456 --> 00:33:46,298
Take this.

504
00:33:49,293 --> 00:33:51,102
Don't feel bad about
what your mother said.

505
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:57,010
She loves your father a lot.

506
00:33:57,402 --> 00:34:02,613
To be honest, men like you are giving
the men of India a tough time.

507
00:34:02,673 --> 00:34:05,085
If there are any more men like you...

508
00:34:05,576 --> 00:34:08,455
...then men will lose our manhood.

509
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:12,656
Take this.

510
00:34:15,753 --> 00:34:18,165
Darling. Come here.

511
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:20,998
Where's the ice!

512
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:22,994
I forgot to get it.

513
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,233
Get it now!

514
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,643
Look, Rakesh,
we are middleclass people.

515
00:34:33,771 --> 00:34:37,378
We're sandwiched between
the upper-class and the lower-class.

516
00:34:38,042 --> 00:34:39,180
The police torture us.

517
00:34:39,777 --> 00:34:41,415
The ministers torture us.

518
00:34:41,479 --> 00:34:43,117
The people torture us too.

519
00:34:43,181 --> 00:34:46,128
Our lives are too stressed.

520
00:34:46,384 --> 00:34:48,091
How do we get rid of it?

521
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:52,461
That's why men like us
come home and beat our wives.

522
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:56,500
There's no other way to vent
out our frustration, my brother.

523
00:34:57,695 --> 00:35:00,369
I have another solution
to your problem.

524
00:35:00,631 --> 00:35:02,201
Come to Mira Road with me.

525
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:05,577
There are beautiful dancers
in the dance bars over there.

526
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:07,644
Be an animal!

527
00:35:07,972 --> 00:35:10,418
Bring out the beast in you!

528
00:35:10,741 --> 00:35:11,947
Hunt!

529
00:35:32,563 --> 00:35:33,598
"II"

530
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:36,574
'I just wanted to send
this message across that...'

531
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:37,977
'...I'm proud of you.'

532
00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:41,240
'I'm confident that..'

533
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,311
'..now you'll do..'

534
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:47,020
'..everything right in life.'

535
00:35:48,045 --> 00:35:49,581
'No matter how many
hardships you face.'

536
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:51,650
'Now there'll be no darkness.'

537
00:35:56,087 --> 00:36:00,627
"Why am I lonely?"

538
00:36:00,958 --> 00:36:05,304
"Why am I living in pieces?"

539
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:15,278
"Why am I lonely?"

540
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:19,913
"Why am I living in pieces?"

541
00:36:20,244 --> 00:36:27,423
"Why is my soul enduring this?"

542
00:36:29,387 --> 00:36:34,393
"I'm incomplete."

543
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:39,271
"l say this every minute."

544
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:44,143
"l need you."

545
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:48,981
"l need you."

546
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:53,614
"l need you."

547
00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:19,412
<i>Samba.</i>

548
00:37:20,304 --> 00:37:21,578
Guru is here.

549
00:37:27,678 --> 00:37:32,491
"l shared a deep
relation with darkness."

550
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:37,226
"You made me aware of light."

551
00:37:37,288 --> 00:37:42,135
"I've returned to
this darkness now."

552
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:46,972
"But it seems unknown to me."

553
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:51,571
"Loneliness has left me."

554
00:37:51,636 --> 00:37:56,107
"Isolation has
refused to accept me."

555
00:37:56,173 --> 00:38:00,986
"I'm incomplete."

556
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:05,585
"I'm a punishment for myself."

557
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:10,463
"l need you."

558
00:38:10,521 --> 00:38:15,300
"l need you."

559
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:20,433
"l need you."

560
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:26,578
Stop!

561
00:39:51,389 --> 00:40:00,309
"I'm incomplete."

562
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:23,289
Put the pistol down!

563
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:30,603
Guru, today I learnt that
the value of dogs is known...

564
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:33,039
...only after a lion arrives.

565
00:40:33,297 --> 00:40:34,469
Why did you kill her?

566
00:40:34,799 --> 00:40:37,541
What? What did you say, Guru?

567
00:40:38,169 --> 00:40:40,080
How could you even think...

568
00:40:41,238 --> 00:40:44,708
...that the one who raised you
like a father and gave you life...

569
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:48,257
...would take away your
reason to live from you?

570
00:40:49,313 --> 00:40:54,353
But if you still feel
that I've killed your Aisha...

571
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:56,460
...then take this gun.

572
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,260
Take it!

573
00:40:58,055 --> 00:40:59,193
And shoot me!

574
00:40:59,523 --> 00:41:03,562
Fire all the bullets in it at me!

575
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:04,970
Why did you kill her?

576
00:41:05,029 --> 00:41:05,939
Shoot me!

577
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:07,602
Shoot rne now!

578
00:41:07,665 --> 00:41:08,643
Shoot me!

579
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:11,305
Don't fear. Shoot me!

580
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,081
Guru.

581
00:41:25,549 --> 00:41:29,019
Don't let this fire
in you douse, Guru!

582
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:32,667
Burn the world with this lava!

583
00:41:33,457 --> 00:41:35,334
Then come back here!

584
00:41:36,293 --> 00:41:38,000
To me!

585
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:43,244
Because a lion deserves
to be in the forest!

586
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:46,104
You are a lion! My lion!

587
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:48,343
You are an idiot!

588
00:41:48,405 --> 00:41:50,385
You're completely useless.

589
00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:53,479
Oh, God! Rakesh Mahadkar,
what do I do with you?

590
00:41:53,544 --> 00:41:55,114
What is all this nonsense!

591
00:42:05,155 --> 00:42:06,225
Madam.
- Brijesh!

592
00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:09,637
I've made a lot of
money in the illegal deal.

593
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:12,401
I've brought your share honestly.

594
00:42:12,663 --> 00:42:14,267
You're very naughty.

595
00:42:14,632 --> 00:42:16,669
Why don't you explain
to your friend?

596
00:42:17,101 --> 00:42:20,207
You're so active,
while he's the laziest.

597
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:21,614
He comes and asks
me what his chances are...

598
00:42:21,672 --> 00:42:24,243
...for being the
employee of the month.

599
00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:27,448
The Xerox machine in this
office works more than you.

600
00:42:27,511 --> 00:42:28,649
The Xerox machine!

601
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,191
Really, you are not worthy
of earning even 2 rupees.

602
00:42:31,248 --> 00:42:33,455
You don't have that talent.

603
00:42:33,517 --> 00:42:36,589
Madam, he is a 2 rupee man.

604
00:42:36,654 --> 00:42:38,190
It's true.

605
00:42:38,255 --> 00:42:41,327
The Xerox machine in this office works
more than you. The Xerox machine!

606
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:45,340
Really, you are not worthy
of earning even 2 rupees.

607
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:46,636
Where are you lost?

608
00:42:47,031 --> 00:42:49,739
Have you come here to repair
the phone or waste your time?

609
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:51,137
Lazy man!

610
00:42:51,468 --> 00:42:53,744
That's why people don't have telephones
in their homes these days.

611
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:55,550
Your service is so bad.

612
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,417
When we call you, you don't come.

613
00:42:57,474 --> 00:42:59,181
And when you come, you don't
even provide proper service.

614
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:01,416
Look, I'm warning
you for the last time.

615
00:43:01,478 --> 00:43:05,119
If my phone doesn't work, then
I'll just get the connection cut.

616
00:43:05,182 --> 00:43:07,958
Then I won't have to
tolerate lazy people like you.

617
00:43:08,018 --> 00:43:08,519
And...

618
00:43:10,354 --> 00:43:12,391
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

619
00:43:12,456 --> 00:43:14,299
Have you come to
repair the phone or...

620
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:16,662
Madam.

621
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:19,297
Don't worry.

622
00:43:20,531 --> 00:43:22,943
You'll have no complaints
against us henceforth.

623
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,412
'You shouldn't have yelled at me.'

624
00:43:28,706 --> 00:43:30,276
Everyone makes fun of me.

625
00:43:31,542 --> 00:43:32,646
They call me lazy.

626
00:43:34,044 --> 00:43:34,988
They call me a beggar.

627
00:43:35,713 --> 00:43:37,192
They abuse me.

628
00:43:38,549 --> 00:43:40,961
'My friend Brijesh is right.'

629
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:43,261
'We're middleclass people...'

630
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:46,393
'...who are sandwiched between
the upper and the lower.'

631
00:43:47,391 --> 00:43:48,699
'The world tortures us.'

632
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,067
'The system tortures us.'

633
00:43:51,762 --> 00:43:53,298
And when we go home,
our wives torture us too.

634
00:43:53,364 --> 00:43:54,672
Today I don't want you in the house.

635
00:43:54,732 --> 00:43:55,972
Get out.

636
00:43:56,266 --> 00:43:57,609
I said out.

637
00:43:58,135 --> 00:44:02,083
Sometimes I feel like killing her.

638
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:07,921
But I can never
raise my hand at her.

639
00:44:10,414 --> 00:44:12,291
I love my wife a lot.

640
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:14,251
<i>'My Sulo.'</i>

641
00:44:15,419 --> 00:44:16,454
'Sulochana.'

642
00:44:17,454 --> 00:44:19,024
'Sulo is her pet name.'

643
00:44:19,757 --> 00:44:21,134
'She means the world to rne.'

644
00:44:22,059 --> 00:44:23,094
'She means everything to rne.'

645
00:44:23,727 --> 00:44:26,207
Creep! Who the hell
do you think you are!

646
00:44:26,263 --> 00:44:27,298
Oh, I know who you are!

647
00:44:27,364 --> 00:44:28,206
A bloody little pig!
- 'You know...

648
00:44:28,532 --> 00:44:29,670
Frustrated pervert!
- You know what?

649
00:44:29,733 --> 00:44:32,714
I've never even looked
at another woman but her.'

650
00:44:34,071 --> 00:44:35,049
'Why should I?'

651
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:38,987
'My Sulo is so beautiful.'
- Look at his face!

652
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:41,651
'She could have found anyone.'

653
00:44:42,446 --> 00:44:44,289
'But she chose me.'

654
00:44:48,385 --> 00:44:50,058
What? Who are you?

655
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:51,321
Telephone maintenance.

656
00:44:52,156 --> 00:44:53,328
I need to check your phone.

657
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:55,059
It'll be done in no time.

658
00:44:55,392 --> 00:44:56,462
Fine. Over there.

659
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:03,307
She has all the right to yell at me.

660
00:45:06,336 --> 00:45:09,476
Yes, I do feel very angry.

661
00:45:14,344 --> 00:45:19,953
And instead of her,
when I kill other women like you...

662
00:45:23,253 --> 00:45:25,290
...l feel much better.

663
00:45:27,157 --> 00:45:29,262
'As all of you die...'

664
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:33,473
<i>'...I</i> get rid of all
my worries and stress.'

665
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:37,337
'Your pain doesn't make me happy.'

666
00:45:38,135 --> 00:45:39,273
'It satisfies me.'

667
00:45:40,204 --> 00:45:41,274
By killing you,“

668
00:45:44,608 --> 00:45:46,554
...l keep my love alive.

669
00:45:47,177 --> 00:45:52,422
And Hake a gift for
my Sulo from every corpse.

670
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:58,157
'Usually,
a person is born ordinary.'

671
00:45:59,022 --> 00:46:00,057
'He lives an ordinary life.'

672
00:46:00,457 --> 00:46:01,527
'He dies ordinarily.'

673
00:46:03,227 --> 00:46:05,070
'If not on the big
screen or in the world...'

674
00:46:05,662 --> 00:46:10,338
'...he should be a hero
at least in his house.'

675
00:46:11,068 --> 00:46:12,103
'I want you to wear it.'

676
00:46:13,036 --> 00:46:14,071
'VVho?'

677
00:46:15,172 --> 00:46:16,116
'Her.'

678
00:46:18,308 --> 00:46:19,218
'You.

679
00:46:20,244 --> 00:46:22,417
'Whose necklace have
you stolen for me?'

680
00:46:25,315 --> 00:46:26,453
'What did you say?'

681
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:28,654
'You think I'm a thief?'

682
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:34,060
Rakesh, what are you doing?
Leave it.

683
00:46:36,393 --> 00:46:40,239
'My Sulo gets happy
when she gets a gift.'

684
00:46:42,065 --> 00:46:43,339
'It makes rne happy, too.'

685
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:44,269
Eat.

686
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:48,340
'My family becomes a happy family.'

687
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:50,047
Are you dieting?

688
00:46:50,107 --> 00:46:52,053
I do this for my family.

689
00:46:52,609 --> 00:46:54,111
'For their happiness.'

690
00:46:55,345 --> 00:46:57,120
'I have just one dream in life.'

691
00:46:58,248 --> 00:47:01,092
'That my Sulo
considers rne her hero.'

692
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:03,658
‘That she tells
me that she loves me.‘

693
00:47:05,222 --> 00:47:06,667
'So that even I can say to her...'

694
00:47:08,592 --> 00:47:11,630
Madam, don't worry.

695
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:16,603
You won't have any complaints
against me henceforth.

696
00:47:28,412 --> 00:47:31,120
A criminal always goes
back to the crime scene.

697
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:34,925
And a lover always comes back
to the place where he fell in love.

698
00:47:35,586 --> 00:47:38,692
I sent you to Goa with high hopes,
to kill Caesar.

699
00:47:43,126 --> 00:47:44,469
Can I tell you a secret?

700
00:47:45,095 --> 00:47:46,938
He didn't kill your wife.

701
00:47:47,397 --> 00:47:48,307
It was someone else.

702
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:54,641
A beast like you who's killing
women using different weapons.

703
00:47:55,606 --> 00:47:58,280
But do you know what
his most special weapon is?

704
00:47:59,643 --> 00:48:00,951
A screwdriver.

705
00:48:02,145 --> 00:48:02,953
Look at this.

706
00:48:04,948 --> 00:48:05,551
He has committed these murders“

707
00:48:06,016 --> 00:48:07,893
..in such brutal ways.

708
00:48:08,285 --> 00:48:12,131
It's difficult to make
out who's someone's mother...

709
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:15,032
...and who's someone's wife.

710
00:48:18,962 --> 00:48:20,168
You're angry, aren't you?

711
00:48:21,031 --> 00:48:22,271
You're furious.

712
00:48:23,667 --> 00:48:26,944
But just as you didn't
let me take my revenge...

713
00:48:27,971 --> 00:48:30,918
...l won't let you
take your revenge either.

714
00:48:34,011 --> 00:48:35,649
Let's see who wins now.

715
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:38,984
Your love or my hatred.

716
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:54,606
Thank you! Thank you!

717
00:48:54,665 --> 00:48:56,941
Bye, dear! Bye!

718
00:49:01,505 --> 00:49:04,179
I want to help you fulfill
the remaining wishes in your diary.

719
00:49:12,716 --> 00:49:14,195
Do you want to hear a joke?

720
00:49:15,652 --> 00:49:16,392
Yes.

721
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:18,990
Forget it. I don't want to say it.

722
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:22,161
Because you'll listen to the joke
as if you're sympathizing with me.

723
00:49:23,393 --> 00:49:24,133
Thank you.

724
00:49:24,428 --> 00:49:26,339
But I don't need it.

725
00:49:27,431 --> 00:49:32,141
I've breathed in this
city as much as I could.

726
00:49:33,103 --> 00:49:38,143
Now it's time to fly to another place
and breathe for as long as I can.

727
00:49:40,277 --> 00:49:41,915
My father was addicted to gambling.

728
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:47,025
He used to bet in cards,
cricket, everything.

729
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:51,364
And one day, he lost so
much that he bet on his life.

730
00:49:52,689 --> 00:49:56,569
'I was 8 years old when my
parents were killed in front of rne.'

731
00:50:01,231 --> 00:50:03,268
'I was hiding under the bed.'

732
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:07,983
'I didn't do anything to save them.'

733
00:50:08,772 --> 00:50:11,719
'After that, people tried
to give rne shelter in their homes.'

734
00:50:12,109 --> 00:50:15,181
'But I didn't want shelter.
I wanted revenge.'

735
00:50:16,747 --> 00:50:18,351
'One day, I took my revenge.'

736
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:22,726
'I killed those people
who orphaned me.'

737
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:28,697
'I thought I'd be
peaceful after that.'

738
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,298
'That I'd be able to sleep.'

739
00:50:35,065 --> 00:50:36,271
'But I was wrong.'

740
00:50:39,102 --> 00:50:42,140
The other day,
when I helped Chotu with you...

741
00:50:43,407 --> 00:50:44,977
...was the first time
that I slept peacefully.

742
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:46,710
I was relaxed.

743
00:50:50,113 --> 00:50:51,091
Why did that happen?

744
00:50:57,554 --> 00:51:00,433
Because for the first time,
you did something for someone else.

745
00:51:02,125 --> 00:51:03,468
Darkness cannot drive out darkness.

746
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:06,563
Only light can do that.

747
00:51:07,998 --> 00:51:09,272
Hate cannot drive out hate.

748
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:11,306
Only love can do that.

749
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:15,383
That 8-year-old child who
was under the bed out of fear...

750
00:51:16,473 --> 00:51:17,975
...is still over there.

751
00:51:19,009 --> 00:51:21,250
He only needs someone's hand.

752
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:24,623
Someone's support.

753
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:28,521
Someone who can pull him out of
the darkness and bring him to light.

754
00:51:32,222 --> 00:51:34,498
Unless we share
someone else's pain...

755
00:51:37,027 --> 00:51:41,407
...we can never relieve
ourselves of pain.

756
00:52:04,354 --> 00:52:09,167
"This is where nightfall happens."

757
00:52:09,493 --> 00:52:14,374
"This is where it's dawn."

758
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:19,307
"This is where I
have to live and die."

759
00:52:19,703 --> 00:52:25,619
"This is where I find spirituality."

760
00:52:37,721 --> 00:52:42,727
"This is where nightfall happens."

761
00:52:42,792 --> 00:52:47,605
"This is where it's dawn."

762
00:52:48,031 --> 00:52:52,707
"This is where I
have to live and die."

763
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:58,552
"This is where I find spirituality."

764
00:52:59,309 --> 00:53:02,051
"Your home."

765
00:53:02,112 --> 00:53:04,285
"Your home."

766
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:09,228
"l find solace in your abode."

767
00:53:09,553 --> 00:53:12,227
"Your home."

768
00:53:12,289 --> 00:53:14,360
"Your home."

769
00:53:14,424 --> 00:53:19,464
"l yearn for your abode."

770
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:45,397
"You sleep in my slumber."

771
00:53:46,122 --> 00:53:50,468
"You cry over my tears."

772
00:53:51,161 --> 00:53:55,974
"Someone whispers in my thoughts."

773
00:53:56,366 --> 00:54:00,644
"l feel your presence
even when you're not around."

774
00:54:00,971 --> 00:54:05,420
"You are the cure..."

775
00:54:06,109 --> 00:54:15,518
"...to my pain."

776
00:54:16,353 --> 00:54:21,302
"You're in my prayers."

777
00:54:21,358 --> 00:54:23,964
"Your home."

778
00:54:24,027 --> 00:54:26,268
"Your home."

779
00:54:26,329 --> 00:54:31,278
"l find solace in your abode."

780
00:54:31,334 --> 00:54:34,281
"Your home."

781
00:54:34,337 --> 00:54:36,339
"Your home."

782
00:54:36,406 --> 00:54:41,685
"l yearn for your abode."

783
00:55:02,732 --> 00:55:07,238
"What kind of a
relationship do we share?"

784
00:55:08,038 --> 00:55:12,680
"It has no name,
but it's still so deep."

785
00:55:13,043 --> 00:55:17,617
"These moments are priceless."

786
00:55:18,248 --> 00:55:22,663
"We might lose them."

787
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:31,264
"Let this moment..."

788
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:38,371
"...come to a halt."

789
00:55:38,435 --> 00:55:42,577
"Don't go away from me."

790
00:55:43,306 --> 00:55:45,684
"Your home."

791
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:48,250
"Your home."

792
00:55:48,311 --> 00:55:53,556
"l yearn for your abode."

793
00:56:31,121 --> 00:56:32,031
Aisha!

794
00:56:38,294 --> 00:56:39,170
Aisha.

795
00:56:42,198 --> 00:56:44,371
I slipped. I'm fine.

796
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:46,577
Aisha, you're not well.
Let's go back.

797
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:48,715
Are you crazy?

798
00:56:50,006 --> 00:56:51,952
Peacocks dance only
on the first rain.

799
00:56:52,442 --> 00:56:54,979
Since we've come this far,
let's wait for some time.

800
00:56:55,044 --> 00:56:56,045
You can see it some other time.

801
00:56:56,112 --> 00:56:56,988
Let's go back now. Come on.

802
00:56:57,313 --> 00:57:00,157
I don't have much time.

803
00:57:21,171 --> 00:57:25,017
The peacock danced already.
Come next year, sir!

804
00:57:25,074 --> 00:57:26,280
It's going to rain heavily.

805
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:35,595
You're back?

806
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:38,565
It's impossible for her to survive.

807
00:57:39,088 --> 00:57:41,261
Please don't waste my time.

808
00:57:41,691 --> 00:57:42,669
I just can't help her.

809
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:50,111
Hey! Who do you think you are!

810
00:57:50,166 --> 00:57:51,702
Are you God!
- What are you doing!

811
00:57:51,768 --> 00:57:53,679
Back off! Are you God
to say that she can't survive!

812
00:57:54,070 --> 00:57:56,676
Save her or I'll kill you today!
Save her!

813
00:57:56,739 --> 00:57:59,618
If I could save her, then wouldn't
I have saved my wife first...

814
00:57:59,676 --> 00:58:02,418
...who is dying each day with cancer!

815
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:09,189
In spite of being a doctor,
I am as helpless as you are.

816
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:20,198
If you have to try one last time...

817
00:58:22,699 --> 00:58:24,542
...then take Aisha to Mumbai.

818
00:58:26,202 --> 00:58:27,476
There's a doctor over there.

819
00:58:28,738 --> 00:58:30,115
Prema Shrivastav.

820
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:32,315
'She couldn't help me.'

821
00:58:33,576 --> 00:58:35,487
'But maybe she can help you.'

822
00:59:22,992 --> 00:59:26,439
Guru, you fulfilled
so many wishes of mine.

823
00:59:26,963 --> 00:59:28,067
Can you fulfil another one?

824
00:59:28,998 --> 00:59:32,605
If I die before
fulfilling all these...

825
00:59:33,736 --> 00:59:36,342
...then you fulfil the rest
of the wishes for me. Okay?

826
00:59:37,273 --> 00:59:39,048
But don't worry.

827
00:59:39,742 --> 00:59:44,213
Even after I die, don't
think that I'll leave you alone.

828
00:59:44,981 --> 00:59:46,551
I'll always be with you.

829
00:59:48,551 --> 00:59:49,689
Like the breeze.

830
00:59:53,156 --> 00:59:58,936
Just close your eyes
and feel the breeze.

831
01:00:01,297 --> 01:00:03,140
Whenever it touches your face...

832
01:00:04,334 --> 01:00:06,041
...it would mean that it's me.

833
01:00:25,054 --> 01:00:26,590
God, thank You.

834
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:29,401
Everything is perfect in my house.

835
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:33,166
Mother and father
don't quarrel anymore.

836
01:00:34,397 --> 01:00:36,274
Please keep everyone happy.

837
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:40,573
And I promise to offer
my cars to you nine more times.

838
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:41,672
Thank you.

839
01:00:45,408 --> 01:00:47,752
God, these are my favourite toys.

840
01:00:48,344 --> 01:00:50,415
Take them away.

841
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:53,188
But please keep my family happy.

842
01:00:54,617 --> 01:00:55,595
Can I help?

843
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:08,309
Did a girl give you this?

844
01:01:08,364 --> 01:01:10,708
No. My father gave it to me.

845
01:01:28,017 --> 01:01:29,655
What are you doing?
You're taking so long.

846
01:01:30,119 --> 01:01:32,099
If we get late,
then the theatre will be full.

847
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:36,060
And anyway, you can't afford
to pay extra for the tickets.

848
01:01:36,793 --> 01:01:37,965
Hurry UP-

849
01:01:44,667 --> 01:01:46,010
We will get the tickets, Sulo.

850
01:01:48,271 --> 01:01:49,306
Don't worry.

851
01:01:50,273 --> 01:01:52,651
Why? ls it your father's theatre?

852
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:54,347
Did you get it as a gift?

853
01:01:54,777 --> 01:01:56,085
Look, I'm warning you.

854
01:01:56,345 --> 01:01:59,724
If I miss the hero's entry, then
I won't watch the rest of the movie.

855
01:02:00,349 --> 01:02:03,626
Anyway, we get to see
a hero only on the big screen...

856
01:02:04,253 --> 01:02:05,459
...and not in real life.

857
01:02:06,355 --> 01:02:08,357
What are you doing, Rakesh?
Leave this.

858
01:02:08,424 --> 01:02:09,266
Give it to me.

859
01:02:29,112 --> 01:02:30,682
Give us some money.

860
01:02:31,013 --> 01:02:33,118
I'll pray you two
always stay together.

861
01:02:33,182 --> 01:02:34,024
Hold on.

862
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:36,427
Give us happily.

863
01:02:36,486 --> 01:02:39,296
Give us some money.
- Give us some money.

864
01:02:39,355 --> 01:02:40,026
Take this.

865
01:02:40,456 --> 01:02:42,163
I don't have more than this.

866
01:02:42,458 --> 01:02:44,563
Okay.

867
01:02:45,261 --> 01:02:46,239
Why did you give them money?

868
01:02:47,330 --> 01:02:48,741
They were harassing us.

869
01:02:49,031 --> 01:02:52,012
If I hadn't given them money,
then they wouldn't have gone.

870
01:02:53,069 --> 01:02:54,673
What kind of a man is he?

871
01:02:55,271 --> 01:02:57,251
Anyone can take advantage of him.

872
01:03:01,010 --> 01:03:04,355
Driver, stop. Please stop.

873
01:03:04,981 --> 01:03:06,426
Why are you getting down?

874
01:03:07,016 --> 01:03:09,189
I don't have money
to go any further.

875
01:03:09,585 --> 01:03:12,293
What?
- I spent all the money, Sulo.

876
01:03:13,689 --> 01:03:15,327
Driver, take this.

877
01:03:17,126 --> 01:03:19,265
Come. Let's go.
- Leave him.

878
01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:22,340
Go.

879
01:03:22,398 --> 01:03:23,706
<i>But Sum...</i>

880
01:03:24,066 --> 01:03:27,172
But what?
You think I don't have any money?

881
01:03:27,703 --> 01:03:30,206
I've saved some money.
It's my money.

882
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:37,117
If I depend on you, then I'll
have to beg on the street someday.

883
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:40,992
Let's go, driver.
- But Sulo... how will I go home?

884
01:03:41,350 --> 01:03:44,160
Just as you go everyday!
In the crowded train!

885
01:03:46,122 --> 01:03:48,602
'I married you with many dreams.'

886
01:03:49,158 --> 01:03:52,298
'But all my dreams have shattered.'

887
01:03:52,361 --> 01:03:54,102
'Every small business man
has a car now.'

888
01:03:54,163 --> 01:03:56,109
'But you'll always remain a beggar.'

889
01:03:56,165 --> 01:03:58,736
'I'm ill fated. It's not your mistake.'

890
01:03:59,035 --> 01:04:01,242
'You're an idiot.'

891
01:04:01,304 --> 01:04:04,080
You're useless, man.

892
01:04:04,407 --> 01:04:06,353
You're completely useless.

893
01:04:07,043 --> 01:04:10,388
Then what happened? You know
what had happened on Christmas?

894
01:04:23,893 --> 01:04:26,601
It's not your cup of tea.

895
01:04:27,029 --> 01:04:29,475
You're running behind her.

896
01:04:29,532 --> 01:04:31,136
But you'll not get her.

897
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:32,372
She won't listen to you.

898
01:04:32,435 --> 01:04:34,540
But will you not listen to me?

899
01:04:34,604 --> 01:04:36,140
I had told you.

900
01:04:36,205 --> 01:04:39,118
Listen to me and do something.

901
01:04:49,385 --> 01:04:50,625
Did you stop laughing now?

902
01:04:52,255 --> 01:04:53,962
You were laughing at me,
weren't you?

903
01:04:55,024 --> 01:04:57,630
All of you like making
fun of me, right?

904
01:05:02,565 --> 01:05:06,172
The Xerox machine in
the office works more than me.

905
01:05:13,209 --> 01:05:15,052
Call your Xerox machine.

906
01:05:15,478 --> 01:05:17,253
To save your life.

907
01:05:20,082 --> 01:05:21,618
Don't worry, madam.

908
01:05:23,452 --> 01:05:27,559
Henceforth, you won't
have any complaints against me.

909
01:05:56,085 --> 01:05:57,496
She slipped and fell.

910
01:05:58,587 --> 01:06:01,898
When I came walking from there,
I saw her lying here.

911
01:06:30,386 --> 01:06:32,957
Hey“ Help.

912
01:06:36,292 --> 01:06:38,363
I won't let you die.

913
01:06:39,595 --> 01:06:41,575
But I will still kill you every day.

914
01:06:42,264 --> 01:06:46,041
Not once, but a thousand times.

915
01:06:46,535 --> 01:06:48,981
You will face death each time...

916
01:06:49,572 --> 01:06:52,075
...but it won't come to you.

917
01:06:52,608 --> 01:06:55,418
The more you try to embrace death...

918
01:06:56,145 --> 01:06:58,352
...the longer you'll live.

919
01:06:58,414 --> 01:07:02,294
I will keep an account of
every drop of blood that you shed.

920
01:07:03,486 --> 01:07:06,626
I will capture your last breath.

921
01:07:07,656 --> 01:07:09,897
I'll hit you so much...

922
01:07:10,726 --> 01:07:13,900
...that you will be in
pain as long as you're alive...

923
01:07:14,330 --> 01:07:17,368
...and your soul will
scream after you die.

924
01:07:32,515 --> 01:07:34,995
Hit me.

925
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:37,031
Hit me. Why do you spare me?

926
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:39,696
Hit me.

927
01:07:56,142 --> 01:07:59,248
Go in and get yourself treated.

928
01:07:59,312 --> 01:08:00,586
First you hit me...

929
01:08:01,214 --> 01:08:02,318
...then you save me...

930
01:08:03,316 --> 01:08:05,262
...and then you bring me
to a hospital and give me money.

931
01:08:06,453 --> 01:08:07,796
Who are you?

932
01:08:08,855 --> 01:08:11,563
lam the one who won't
let you die in peace...

933
01:08:12,125 --> 01:08:13,695
...nor will I let you live in peace.

934
01:08:15,728 --> 01:08:18,208
Get the medicine.
Get yourself cured.

935
01:08:19,199 --> 01:08:21,076
Because once your pain is soothed...

936
01:08:22,335 --> 01:08:24,110
...once your wounds are healed...

937
01:08:24,404 --> 01:08:27,647
...I'll be back to
inflict new wounds.

938
01:08:28,675 --> 01:08:30,677
This is your fate now.

939
01:08:31,277 --> 01:08:32,620
This is your punishment.

940
01:08:41,488 --> 01:08:44,162
Mother, who hit father?

941
01:08:44,557 --> 01:08:45,399
Keep quiet.

942
01:08:45,658 --> 01:08:46,329
Go out.

943
01:08:49,762 --> 01:08:52,675
Listen. Stay inside the hospital.

944
01:08:53,199 --> 01:08:55,475
Don't go out. Okay?

945
01:08:57,804 --> 01:08:59,306
Your boss was attacked yesterday.

946
01:09:00,106 --> 01:09:01,141
Today you were attacked.

947
01:09:01,407 --> 01:09:03,478
Either the whole office
has a lot of enemies...

948
01:09:03,543 --> 01:09:05,352
...or you're each other's enemies.

949
01:09:05,411 --> 01:09:07,482
Come on. Tell me from the beginning.

950
01:09:07,547 --> 01:09:09,549
Excuse me. What are you doing?

951
01:09:09,849 --> 01:09:11,795
You're not allowed to give
outside food to the patient.

952
01:09:12,318 --> 01:09:14,389
Do you want him to eat
the hospital food?

953
01:09:14,454 --> 01:09:16,127
Do you intend to make him sick?

954
01:09:16,489 --> 01:09:18,264
These are the rules of the hospital.

955
01:09:18,324 --> 01:09:21,100
You're not allowed to give
the patient anything besides fruits.

956
01:09:21,161 --> 01:09:22,231
Close your lunchbox.

957
01:09:22,295 --> 01:09:24,241
I'm closing it.
Can't you see? I won't give him.

958
01:09:24,297 --> 01:09:25,173
But they didn't listen.

959
01:09:25,498 --> 01:09:26,374
I'm warning you.

960
01:09:26,766 --> 01:09:29,542
This will not be tolerated here.
- Then they started hitting me.

961
01:09:29,602 --> 01:09:30,512
I can't believe this.

962
01:09:30,570 --> 01:09:33,779
You can't help it, sir.
Some people are very bad.

963
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:35,376
Fine. I'll come back for
more information.

964
01:09:35,441 --> 01:09:36,749
- Show me those medicines.

965
01:09:38,244 --> 01:09:40,417
You've never even
killed a fly at home.

966
01:09:42,415 --> 01:09:46,022
What was the need to hit goons
on the street and try to be a hero?

967
01:09:46,519 --> 01:09:48,624
Look at your face.
Look what you've done to yourself.

968
01:09:49,289 --> 01:09:51,394
Moreover, you got yourself
admitted in such a reputed hospital.

969
01:09:51,791 --> 01:09:55,034
How will we pay the fees?

970
01:09:59,332 --> 01:10:00,242
Take this.

971
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:01,744
For the fees.

972
01:10:11,678 --> 01:10:13,123
This...

973
01:10:22,088 --> 01:10:23,761
I don't like to yell at you.

974
01:10:27,093 --> 01:10:28,663
But if something
had happened to you...

975
01:10:31,531 --> 01:10:33,067
...then what would my Manu have done?

976
01:10:34,734 --> 01:10:35,769
I'm sorry, Sulo.

977
01:10:41,241 --> 01:10:42,447
I love you.

978
01:10:51,651 --> 01:10:52,459
What's this?

979
01:10:53,453 --> 01:10:56,161
I just told you that he's
not allowed to eat outside food.

980
01:10:56,222 --> 01:10:58,498
Don't you understand
when you're explained once?

981
01:10:58,558 --> 01:11:00,731
Security!
- Why are you calling the security?

982
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:03,606
What's your job?
To clean everyone's mess.

983
01:11:04,397 --> 01:11:06,308
But you're behaving like a queen.

984
01:11:06,566 --> 01:11:09,046
Sulo. - I wonder
where they've come from.

985
01:11:09,102 --> 01:11:10,080
You leave.

986
01:11:12,238 --> 01:11:13,239
Take care.

987
01:11:15,074 --> 01:11:16,109
I'm sorry, madam.

988
01:11:16,476 --> 01:11:18,615
I shouldn't have any
complaints henceforth.

989
01:11:44,370 --> 01:11:46,008
I can't get there.

990
01:12:03,189 --> 01:12:05,226
God!

991
01:12:06,059 --> 01:12:09,666
I'm sorry. I couldn't come
to pray this week.

992
01:12:16,169 --> 01:12:16,738
Guru?

993
01:12:18,237 --> 01:12:19,648
Are you okay?

994
01:12:21,407 --> 01:12:23,011
Listen, I'm really sorry.

995
01:12:23,843 --> 01:12:26,221
I can't believe that
this happened to Aisha.

996
01:12:26,679 --> 01:12:29,182
God plays such
strange games with us.

997
01:12:30,216 --> 01:12:33,629
She was going to bring
a new life into this world, but...

998
01:12:35,088 --> 01:12:36,032
Yes.

999
01:12:36,489 --> 01:12:37,763
She was pregnant.

1000
01:12:38,758 --> 01:12:40,237
Didn't she tell you?

1001
01:12:42,595 --> 01:12:45,007
Anyway, I'm really sorry.

1002
01:12:45,431 --> 01:12:47,468
Please take care of yourself.

1003
01:13:13,059 --> 01:13:14,402
Again this tube light
started flickering.

1004
01:13:16,062 --> 01:13:17,507
There's no maintenance here.

1005
01:14:06,045 --> 01:14:08,025
The more you struggle...

1006
01:14:09,081 --> 01:14:10,560
...the more it'll hurt.

1007
01:14:12,084 --> 01:14:14,724
If you slay calm,
I'll kill you lovingly.

1008
01:14:53,326 --> 01:14:55,670
You killed my baby.

1009
01:14:55,728 --> 01:14:57,571
You killed my baby!

1010
01:14:57,630 --> 01:14:59,405
She was pregnant.

1011
01:15:02,068 --> 01:15:04,048
She was pregnant!

1012
01:15:04,103 --> 01:15:05,275
You killed my baby.

1013
01:15:05,638 --> 01:15:07,379
She was pregnant!

1014
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:09,351
She was pregnant!

1015
01:15:09,408 --> 01:15:11,012
She was pregnant!

1016
01:15:13,546 --> 01:15:15,048
She was pregnant!

1017
01:15:15,448 --> 01:15:17,519
She was pregnant!

1018
01:15:17,583 --> 01:15:19,187
You killed my baby!

1019
01:15:19,619 --> 01:15:23,157
He's dead! He's dead!

1020
01:15:36,335 --> 01:15:37,109
Get up!

1021
01:15:39,272 --> 01:15:42,549
Get up!

1022
01:15:44,644 --> 01:15:47,591
You can't die so easily.

1023
01:15:47,647 --> 01:15:48,625
Get up!

1024
01:15:49,048 --> 01:15:51,722
You can't die so easily! Get up!

1025
01:15:52,718 --> 01:15:58,293
Hey! You can't die so easily!
Get up!

1026
01:15:59,058 --> 01:16:00,469
Hey! Make him alive.

1027
01:16:00,526 --> 01:16:04,531
Please let rne go! I won't tell anyone!
- Hey! He must live for rne.

1028
01:16:05,097 --> 01:16:07,043
He can't die so easily!

1029
01:16:07,099 --> 01:16:08,271
Bring him back to life!

1030
01:16:15,441 --> 01:16:19,184
Get up!
- He needs..

1031
01:16:20,246 --> 01:16:25,218
This... has to go... in his heart...

1032
01:16:49,175 --> 01:16:51,280
He killed your baby.

1033
01:16:53,446 --> 01:16:55,483
Even then you saved his life?

1034
01:16:56,248 --> 01:16:57,192
Why?

1035
01:16:59,185 --> 01:17:00,994
Why didn't you let him die?

1036
01:17:01,654 --> 01:17:03,998
Spare my son, Guru.

1037
01:17:08,995 --> 01:17:11,032
The man who killed your son...

1038
01:17:11,330 --> 01:17:13,708
...is he present in the court?

1039
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:17,308
Madam, is he present in the court?

1040
01:17:18,270 --> 01:17:19,271
Answer me.

1041
01:17:23,142 --> 01:17:24,018
No.

1042
01:17:27,380 --> 01:17:28,620
He's not here.

1043
01:17:29,382 --> 01:17:30,986
Hold the police also.

1044
01:17:31,684 --> 01:17:36,258
Deepu's death was an accident.

1045
01:17:36,322 --> 01:17:40,168
Due to lack of evidence, Deepu's
death is declared an accident...

1046
01:17:40,226 --> 01:17:42,206
...and this case is dismissed.

1047
01:17:42,261 --> 01:17:44,298
Accused is set free.

1048
01:17:53,305 --> 01:17:55,546
I haven't forgotten my son's death.

1049
01:17:57,076 --> 01:17:58,646
Nor am I scared of you.

1050
01:17:59,578 --> 01:18:03,720
You want to know why I didn't
testify against you, don't you?

1051
01:18:05,117 --> 01:18:12,092
Because you will be punished
not by a judge in court but by God.

1052
01:18:13,092 --> 01:18:15,197
How did you get away from
the bullets the other day?

1053
01:18:16,162 --> 01:18:20,167
Because He has a punishment
worse than death for you.

1054
01:18:21,534 --> 01:18:24,640
One day, your dear one
will die in front of you.

1055
01:18:26,338 --> 01:18:28,181
And you won't be able to save him.

1056
01:18:36,849 --> 01:18:38,624
Passenger, please pay attention.

1057
01:18:38,684 --> 01:18:41,358
Janshatabdi express from
Goa to Mumbai“

1058
01:18:41,420 --> 01:18:44,128
..will depart from platform number <i>6</i>
on it's scheduled time.

1059
01:18:44,190 --> 01:18:46,227
Aisha.

1060
01:18:46,292 --> 01:18:48,033
You're always running in life.

1061
01:18:49,161 --> 01:18:51,038
From one place to another.

1062
01:18:53,099 --> 01:18:54,510
Who are you running away from today?

1063
01:18:55,167 --> 01:18:56,612
I'm not running away from anyone.

1064
01:18:56,669 --> 01:19:00,708
Look, dear,
there is a kind of laughter...

1065
01:19:00,773 --> 01:19:05,017
...which a person learns
to hide his sorrow in life.

1066
01:19:05,644 --> 01:19:07,487
And there is another
kind of laughter...

1067
01:19:07,813 --> 01:19:10,589
...that helps a person
forget all his sorrow.

1068
01:19:11,617 --> 01:19:15,087
You've found this laughter
after meeting Guru.

1069
01:19:16,789 --> 01:19:18,268
You've found it in his love.

1070
01:19:20,159 --> 01:19:21,729
What's the use of this love...

1071
01:19:24,296 --> 01:19:26,469
...that will make him
cry after making him smile?

1072
01:19:29,101 --> 01:19:30,239
I'm not running away from him.

1073
01:19:32,738 --> 01:19:35,082
I'm just stopping him
from running after me.

1074
01:19:35,141 --> 01:19:35,642
Aisha!

1075
01:19:36,442 --> 01:19:37,284
Aisha!

1076
01:19:43,382 --> 01:19:44,383
Aisha!

1077
01:19:47,052 --> 01:19:48,190
Aisha!

1078
01:20:02,101 --> 01:20:02,704
Aisha.

1079
01:20:03,302 --> 01:20:04,007
Aisha!

1080
01:20:04,537 --> 01:20:05,345
Do you want to hear a joke?

1081
01:20:07,139 --> 01:20:08,618
Once, a man was drowning in the sea.

1082
01:20:09,575 --> 01:20:11,782
He started praying
to God to save him.

1083
01:20:11,844 --> 01:20:13,152
A fishing boat came.

1084
01:20:14,246 --> 01:20:15,520
He said, "Give me your hand."

1085
01:20:16,115 --> 01:20:17,753
The man said, "No.
God will save me."

1086
01:20:18,517 --> 01:20:19,655
Then a ship came.

1087
01:20:20,286 --> 01:20:21,424
The captain said, "Hold my hand."

1088
01:20:21,687 --> 01:20:24,167
He said, "No. God will save me."

1089
01:20:24,223 --> 01:20:25,531
The man drowned.

1090
01:20:26,358 --> 01:20:30,238
After his death, he asked God,
"Why didn't You save me?"

1091
01:20:30,296 --> 01:20:33,470
God said, "You think your
father sent that boat and ship?"

1092
01:20:38,704 --> 01:20:42,584
Aisha, I know that I might
not be able to save you from dying.

1093
01:20:44,076 --> 01:20:47,285
But by holding my hand,
you can keep me alive.

1094
01:20:49,648 --> 01:20:51,286
Hold my hand, Aisha.

1095
01:20:52,318 --> 01:20:54,423
And get me out of
darkness into light.

1096
01:20:56,322 --> 01:20:57,699
Hold my hand, Aisha!

1097
01:20:58,490 --> 01:21:00,663
Pull me out of darkness
into light, Aisha!

1098
01:21:04,430 --> 01:21:05,773
Aisha, don't go.

1099
01:21:07,566 --> 01:21:08,544
Aisha!

1100
01:21:10,102 --> 01:21:12,343
Aisha, don't go.

1101
01:21:21,480 --> 01:21:24,484
Aisha, don't leave me.

1102
01:21:27,219 --> 01:21:29,460
Aisha.

1103
01:22:17,836 --> 01:22:19,372
Hey! Who pulled the chain?

1104
01:22:27,313 --> 01:22:37,030
"Why does life comprise
of just a few moments?"

1105
01:22:37,823 --> 01:22:42,101
"Even centuries..."

1106
01:22:42,494 --> 01:22:47,409
"mare not enough for love."

1107
01:22:47,733 --> 01:22:53,081
"l want to ask God..."

1108
01:22:53,138 --> 01:22:58,087
"...for some more time."

1109
01:22:58,377 --> 01:23:03,053
"l want to stay here forever."

1110
01:23:03,315 --> 01:23:09,288
"l don't want to be away from you."

1111
01:23:09,355 --> 01:23:14,429
"When you're my companion."

1112
01:23:14,493 --> 01:23:19,374
"When you're my companion."

1113
01:23:19,732 --> 01:23:24,647
"No pain seems painful."

1114
01:23:25,237 --> 01:23:30,448
"When you're my companion."

1115
01:23:30,743 --> 01:23:33,155
After meeting Aisha,
I've realised...

1116
01:23:33,212 --> 01:23:35,055
...that it's very
easy to kill someone.

1117
01:23:35,681 --> 01:23:37,661
But it's very difficult
to save someone's life.

1118
01:23:40,686 --> 01:23:42,097
You may kill me if you want.

1119
01:23:43,088 --> 01:23:45,034
But I won't kill anyone again.

1120
01:24:01,673 --> 01:24:03,016
Go.

1121
01:24:05,277 --> 01:24:07,553
Go. I'm fine.

1122
01:24:13,185 --> 01:24:18,396
"Your smile is my strength."

1123
01:24:18,457 --> 01:24:23,702
"I've found hope because of it."

1124
01:24:23,762 --> 01:24:29,110
"No matter how much
the world torments me..."

1125
01:24:29,168 --> 01:24:33,708
"...l find solace in it."

1126
01:24:33,772 --> 01:24:39,245
"Life has become beautiful."

1127
01:24:39,311 --> 01:24:44,590
"This is heaven."

1128
01:24:44,650 --> 01:24:49,326
"When you're my companion."

1129
01:24:49,788 --> 01:24:54,533
"When you're my companion."

1130
01:24:55,127 --> 01:25:00,440
"No pain seems painful."

1131
01:25:00,499 --> 01:25:05,244
"When you're my companion."

1132
01:25:08,740 --> 01:25:11,084
These are Aisha's latest
pathological tests.

1133
01:25:29,328 --> 01:25:30,329
Here's your dairy.

1134
01:25:33,432 --> 01:25:35,605
You have time to fulfill
every wish of yours.

1135
01:25:37,102 --> 01:25:39,673
We have the time.
- Yes.

1136
01:25:40,539 --> 01:25:43,486
We will fulfill it together.
- Yes.

1137
01:25:46,178 --> 01:25:47,418
You have the rest
of your life, Aisha.

1138
01:25:51,483 --> 01:25:53,053
You have the rest of your life.

1139
01:25:55,020 --> 01:25:56,226
You will live, Aisha.

1140
01:25:57,556 --> 01:25:58,534
You will live, Aisha.

1141
01:25:59,791 --> 01:26:00,963
You will live.

1142
01:26:09,635 --> 01:26:14,584
"My life depends
on your heartbeats."

1143
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:20,285
"Your desires are now my prayers."

1144
01:26:20,345 --> 01:26:25,556
"This is such an unusual bond."

1145
01:26:25,617 --> 01:26:30,293
"We're one now."

1146
01:26:30,355 --> 01:26:35,498
"l will come back to you."

1147
01:26:35,561 --> 01:26:41,102
"l promise you."
"Even if I die."

1148
01:26:41,166 --> 01:26:46,343
"When you're my companion."

1149
01:26:46,405 --> 01:26:50,683
"When you're my companion."

1150
01:26:51,610 --> 01:26:57,083
"No pain seems painful."

1151
01:26:57,149 --> 01:27:02,223
"When you're my companion."

1152
01:27:02,287 --> 01:27:06,997
"When you're my companion."

1153
01:27:07,626 --> 01:27:12,166
"When you're my companion."

1154
01:27:13,031 --> 01:27:18,242
"When you're my companion."

1155
01:27:18,303 --> 01:27:23,218
"When you're my companion."

1156
01:27:27,546 --> 01:27:28,320
ls this okay?

1157
01:27:28,814 --> 01:27:30,384
You look like a hero.

1158
01:27:30,449 --> 01:27:32,395
If I was the interviewer,
do you know what I would have done?

1159
01:27:34,519 --> 01:27:36,362
Wait. Let me get curd
and sugar for good luck.

1160
01:27:41,393 --> 01:27:42,303
Hi, Dr. Prema.

1161
01:27:42,594 --> 01:27:44,164
Aisha, your reports have come.

1162
01:27:45,330 --> 01:27:47,173
And they state that you're pregnant.

1163
01:27:49,268 --> 01:27:50,713
Aisha!

1164
01:27:51,403 --> 01:27:53,440
Are you there?
- Yeah.

1165
01:27:54,673 --> 01:27:55,651
Doctor...

1166
01:27:57,809 --> 01:28:00,585
Will my illness have
a negative effect on my baby?

1167
01:28:01,313 --> 01:28:04,851
No, Aisha.
Your baby is not in danger.

1168
01:28:04,983 --> 01:28:06,860
But I'm concerned about you.

1169
01:28:07,185 --> 01:28:10,689
Aisha, I don't think you have the
strength to give birth to this baby.

1170
01:28:11,490 --> 01:28:13,731
You've just come into
remission from your illness.

1171
01:28:14,259 --> 01:28:16,569
Your body is still very weak.

1172
01:28:17,195 --> 01:28:22,645
I think you should tell Guru
about your pregnancy and this risk.

1173
01:28:23,702 --> 01:28:26,683
'He's the father of this child.
He has a right to know.'

1174
01:28:27,172 --> 01:28:30,278
'You both must take this decision
and that too very quickly.'

1175
01:28:30,342 --> 01:28:32,219
Aisha, what are you doing?
It's behind.

1176
01:28:39,618 --> 01:28:40,323
Listen.

1177
01:28:46,258 --> 01:28:47,236
Best of luck.

1178
01:29:56,128 --> 01:29:59,735
Aisha, are you sure
you want this child?

1179
01:30:00,465 --> 01:30:02,308
Did you tell Guru?

1180
01:30:03,802 --> 01:30:05,281
I will tell him.

1181
01:30:07,339 --> 01:30:08,682
I'm just afraid...

1182
01:30:10,675 --> 01:30:15,249
...that if he feels that something might
happen to me because of this baby...

1183
01:30:17,182 --> 01:30:19,025
...then he'll try to stop me.

1184
01:30:19,618 --> 01:30:21,393
But his fear is justified, dear.

1185
01:30:26,458 --> 01:30:28,734
But this life that
I've got because of Guru...

1186
01:30:31,430 --> 01:30:37,779
...is playing
hide-and-seek with death.

1187
01:30:39,638 --> 01:30:42,118
It has to end someday.

1188
01:30:44,109 --> 01:30:46,715
Then my Guru will be
back into the darkness.

1189
01:30:50,382 --> 01:30:54,455
He will need someone then,
who'll hold his hand...

1190
01:30:54,519 --> 01:30:56,089
...and bring him into light.

1191
01:30:56,755 --> 01:30:58,359
And the one who'll hold his hand...

1192
01:31:00,091 --> 01:31:01,399
...will be our child.

1193
01:31:05,831 --> 01:31:07,469
My child, light and darkness means life.

1194
01:31:09,100 --> 01:31:12,479
Now, He'll show you the correct path.

1195
01:31:13,605 --> 01:31:16,552
The Lord's and my blessings
are always with you.

1196
01:31:21,580 --> 01:31:23,617
Have you worked somewhere earlier?

1197
01:31:30,722 --> 01:31:33,328
Actually, I shouldn't crack
jokes about God in front of God.

1198
01:31:33,391 --> 01:31:36,395
I'm sorry.
Don't mind, but I have no mind.

1199
01:31:36,461 --> 01:31:37,462
Catch“ catch.

1200
01:31:41,166 --> 01:31:42,270
Oh gosh!

1201
01:31:48,139 --> 01:31:51,746
Hey, mister!
Yes, I'm talking to you.

1202
01:31:52,277 --> 01:31:54,985
Aren't there enough potholes in the
city that you've dug another one?

1203
01:31:55,380 --> 01:31:57,326
For the past two weeks.

1204
01:31:57,382 --> 01:31:59,692
Those kids and my God were
saved by a hair's breadth today.

1205
01:31:59,751 --> 01:32:00,752
'All my dreams have shattered.'

1206
01:32:01,086 --> 01:32:03,396
'It's not your mistake,
I'm ill fated.'

1207
01:32:03,455 --> 01:32:05,594
'I had many choices.'

1208
01:32:05,657 --> 01:32:08,103
'But I was ill fated to marry you.'

1209
01:32:08,159 --> 01:32:10,002
'Middle class man.'

1210
01:32:10,829 --> 01:32:12,274
Don't worry, madam.

1211
01:32:12,664 --> 01:32:14,769
You won't have any
complaints henceforth.

1212
01:32:15,066 --> 01:32:17,546
Fine. Let's see.

1213
01:32:22,841 --> 01:32:23,683
Hello.

1214
01:32:24,476 --> 01:32:26,114
Do you want to hear the
bad news first or the worst news?

1215
01:32:26,511 --> 01:32:28,422
The bad news is that you'll
have to live without me every day...

1216
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:29,754
...between 9 to 5 from now on.

1217
01:32:31,550 --> 01:32:33,393
And the worst news is that I
won't be able to live without you...

1218
01:32:33,451 --> 01:32:34,725
...between 9 to 5 from now on.

1219
01:32:35,287 --> 01:32:36,459
I got the job, Aisha.

1220
01:32:37,455 --> 01:32:38,433
I got the job.

1221
01:32:39,491 --> 01:32:40,629
I'm independent now.

1222
01:32:41,526 --> 01:32:45,406
Guru, there's something
that I have to say to you.

1223
01:32:45,764 --> 01:32:46,469
Tell me.

1224
01:32:47,465 --> 01:32:49,001
No. Come home first.

1225
01:32:49,067 --> 01:32:50,637
Tell me. I'm on my way home.

1226
01:32:51,036 --> 01:32:52,208
No, come home.

1227
01:32:55,273 --> 01:32:57,685
Hello. How did you get in?

1228
01:32:57,742 --> 01:32:58,584
Aisha?

1229
01:33:00,245 --> 01:33:01,246
What are you doing?
- Aisha?

1230
01:33:01,713 --> 01:33:03,192
Does anyone barge
into someone's house...

1231
01:33:03,248 --> 01:33:04,226
...without ringing the bell?

1232
01:33:04,282 --> 01:33:05,454
Get out of here!

1233
01:33:07,085 --> 01:33:08,587
Aisha, who's over there? Aisha!

1234
01:33:10,422 --> 01:33:12,527
Who is it? What happened, Aisha?

1235
01:33:13,391 --> 01:33:15,029
Hey! Aisha!

1236
01:33:15,393 --> 01:33:17,430
Listen! Whoever you are,
you're my enemy.

1237
01:33:17,796 --> 01:33:20,777
Guru!

1238
01:33:20,832 --> 01:33:22,470
It's not her mistake.
Spare her. Aisha!

1239
01:33:22,534 --> 01:33:25,242
Hey! Listen! Spare her. Aisha!

1240
01:33:26,104 --> 01:33:26,741
Aisha!
- Guru!

1241
01:33:27,072 --> 01:33:28,449
Stop! Taxi! Stop!

1242
01:33:28,506 --> 01:33:32,079
Aisha! - Guru!
- Aisha! I'm coming.

1243
01:33:34,179 --> 01:33:35,351
Help me.

1244
01:33:40,585 --> 01:33:41,620
I'm pregnant.

1245
01:33:44,422 --> 01:33:46,026
Please don't kill me.

1246
01:33:49,027 --> 01:33:51,098
I want to give birth to this baby.

1247
01:33:52,664 --> 01:33:54,075
I want to have this child.

1248
01:33:56,267 --> 01:33:57,575
Please don't kill me.

1249
01:33:57,636 --> 01:34:01,243
Stop! Taxi, stop.

1250
01:35:26,458 --> 01:35:29,234
Hurry up, deep-

1251
01:36:07,298 --> 01:36:08,208
HI.

1252
01:36:09,467 --> 01:36:12,505
Am I disturbing you?

1253
01:36:14,506 --> 01:36:17,976
I see. You were following Rakesh.

1254
01:36:19,043 --> 01:36:19,612
Go.

1255
01:36:22,213 --> 01:36:23,157
Run.

1256
01:36:24,516 --> 01:36:25,654
Run!

1257
01:36:26,785 --> 01:36:28,162
Hey, back off.

1258
01:36:28,419 --> 01:36:29,591
Back“

1259
01:36:29,654 --> 01:36:31,531
Just a minute, Madam. Madam.

1260
01:36:32,190 --> 01:36:33,134
Madam, do you know
where your husband is?

1261
01:36:33,691 --> 01:36:36,194
Please, let us go.

1262
01:36:36,261 --> 01:36:39,504
We didn't do anything.

1263
01:36:40,665 --> 01:36:42,702
I think there's
some misunderstandings.

1264
01:36:43,168 --> 01:36:45,239
My husband didn't do anything.

1265
01:36:45,303 --> 01:36:46,941
Do you remember what I told you?

1266
01:36:47,539 --> 01:36:50,486
Whenever you try to take
your revenge, I'll come in your way.

1267
01:36:51,209 --> 01:36:52,085
Do you remember!

1268
01:37:01,252 --> 01:37:03,289
I know you're not
scared of my bullet.

1269
01:37:04,455 --> 01:37:07,993
You know that if you follow him,
then the police will catch him.

1270
01:37:08,626 --> 01:37:12,039
His crime will be proved and your
revenge will be left incomplete.

1271
01:37:17,135 --> 01:37:19,308
<i>Rakes!“!</i>

1272
01:37:19,370 --> 01:37:21,247
Get inside.

1273
01:37:23,174 --> 01:37:25,381
The police will catch
Rakesh Mahadkar eventually.

1274
01:37:26,110 --> 01:37:27,987
Because his wife
is in their custody.

1275
01:37:28,513 --> 01:37:31,619
But for now,
let's go to the police station.

1276
01:37:32,483 --> 01:37:34,622
Someone's waiting
for you over there.

1277
01:37:47,065 --> 01:37:48,339
Hey!

1278
01:37:49,067 --> 01:37:50,341
You got beaten again?

1279
01:37:50,401 --> 01:37:51,402
Will you come with me to Mira Road?

1280
01:37:51,803 --> 01:37:53,282
Mira Road!

1281
01:37:53,338 --> 01:37:54,783
You've become a man!

1282
01:37:55,073 --> 01:37:56,211
Take me away from here.

1283
01:37:56,274 --> 01:38:00,620
After being beaten, you
want someone to heal your wounds.

1284
01:38:00,678 --> 01:38:05,184
Rakesh Mahadkar is the one
who killed women in the city.

1285
01:38:05,250 --> 01:38:06,490
He's absconding.

1286
01:38:06,551 --> 01:38:09,532
But police is making all
the efforts to nab him.

1287
01:38:10,655 --> 01:38:12,134
Look there.

1288
01:38:23,134 --> 01:38:29,642
"The world wants to
touch me in such a way..."

1289
01:38:32,410 --> 01:38:39,294
"was if I belong to them."

1290
01:38:41,519 --> 01:38:48,095
"The world looks at my beauty."

1291
01:38:50,795 --> 01:38:56,711
"No one understands
my helplessness."

1292
01:38:59,304 --> 01:39:06,244
"I'm shattered completely."

1293
01:39:06,811 --> 01:39:08,552
Wow!

1294
01:39:08,613 --> 01:39:16,623
"I've gone crazy in your love."

1295
01:39:17,655 --> 01:39:26,075
"I'm shattered completely."

1296
01:39:26,130 --> 01:39:27,108
Come on.

1297
01:39:27,165 --> 01:39:34,447
"I've gone crazy in your love."

1298
01:39:39,344 --> 01:39:41,051
You're lying.

1299
01:39:42,780 --> 01:39:44,555
Sir, Hold you.

1300
01:39:44,615 --> 01:39:48,028
The one who saved
my life was a saviour.

1301
01:39:48,086 --> 01:39:50,123
I couldn't recognise him.

1302
01:39:50,421 --> 01:39:51,695
Tell me something.

1303
01:39:52,090 --> 01:39:52,761
Note down the details.

1304
01:39:52,824 --> 01:39:54,098
Whether old or young...

1305
01:39:54,158 --> 01:39:56,365
...why doesn't any woman
testify against you?

1306
01:39:58,563 --> 01:40:01,772
Do you have a mole at
a special place in your body?

1307
01:40:03,267 --> 01:40:05,213
Wagle, take him in the custody.

1308
01:40:13,411 --> 01:40:17,382
"Some call me their pride."

1309
01:40:18,149 --> 01:40:22,029
"Some pay me a price."

1310
01:40:22,320 --> 01:40:26,359
"l smile at them."

1311
01:40:27,291 --> 01:40:31,637
"But I'm crying from within."

1312
01:40:31,696 --> 01:40:36,145
"You were priceless."

1313
01:40:36,200 --> 01:40:40,615
"You would talk a lot."

1314
01:40:41,506 --> 01:40:46,080
"Since you're quiet..."

1315
01:40:46,144 --> 01:40:52,322
"...you've taken all
my happiness away."

1316
01:40:57,121 --> 01:41:05,063
"I'm shattered."

1317
01:41:06,230 --> 01:41:14,775
"I'm ruined in your love."

1318
01:41:15,306 --> 01:41:22,087
"l belong lo you completely."

1319
01:41:24,615 --> 01:41:32,033
"I've been bought by you."

1320
01:41:50,808 --> 01:41:54,688
I always thought you were a loser.

1321
01:41:55,346 --> 01:41:59,294
But you proved me wrong.

1322
01:41:59,717 --> 01:42:04,063
Do you know how many
blessings you must have got...

1323
01:42:04,122 --> 01:42:06,124
...from those men
whose wives you killed?

1324
01:42:06,557 --> 01:42:10,198
But what did my friendship lack?

1325
01:42:10,661 --> 01:42:13,505
Why did you spare my wife?

1326
01:42:14,665 --> 01:42:16,736
Why are you sitting here?

1327
01:42:19,170 --> 01:42:21,081
Hey, handsome.
Will you come to the pool?

1328
01:42:21,139 --> 01:42:22,618
Hey, hot baby!

1329
01:42:24,108 --> 01:42:25,712
Tell me something.

1330
01:42:25,776 --> 01:42:30,191
Do you want to sing a solo song
with him or a duet with both of us?

1331
01:42:30,248 --> 01:42:34,492
Looks like your friend is neither
interested in a solo, nor in a duet.

1332
01:42:34,552 --> 01:42:39,501
I think he's either
impotent or he likes men.

1333
01:42:39,557 --> 01:42:45,098
You're talking too much.
But you don't know my friend.

1334
01:42:45,163 --> 01:42:49,270
Brother, you'll have to shut her up.

1335
01:42:49,333 --> 01:42:51,040
Come on. Have a drink.

1336
01:42:52,203 --> 01:42:53,739
Darling, where's the ice?

1337
01:42:54,172 --> 01:42:56,049
I'll just get it.

1338
01:42:57,241 --> 01:43:03,021
Hot girls forget to
get the coldest thing.

1339
01:43:05,316 --> 01:43:07,227
Who is this man who's after me?

1340
01:43:08,085 --> 01:43:11,498
He too is his wife's lover,
just like you.

1341
01:43:13,724 --> 01:43:17,729
I'm sure he's the husband
Of one of the women that you killed.

1342
01:43:17,795 --> 01:43:19,001
I'm sure.

1343
01:43:19,297 --> 01:43:20,298
100 percent.

1344
01:43:23,601 --> 01:43:25,547
He's playing with you.

1345
01:43:26,304 --> 01:43:29,615
Just as a lion plays
with his prey in the forest.

1346
01:43:30,374 --> 01:43:33,514
He catches it and then let's it go,
and then catches it again.

1347
01:43:34,145 --> 01:43:37,683
He chases it, catches it and
then let's it go again.

1348
01:43:40,084 --> 01:43:45,295
Until you keep running,
he'll keep chasing you.

1349
01:43:46,324 --> 01:43:50,636
The day you turn the tables,
you'll be the hunter.

1350
01:43:51,696 --> 01:43:53,403
And he'll be the prey.

1351
01:43:58,703 --> 01:44:00,614
'I won't let you die.'

1352
01:44:02,173 --> 01:44:04,210
'But I will still
kill you every day.'

1353
01:44:04,475 --> 01:44:07,217
'The more you try
to embrace death...'

1354
01:44:08,045 --> 01:44:09,991
'...the longer you'll live.'

1355
01:44:19,757 --> 01:44:21,737
'She was pregnant.'

1356
01:44:23,394 --> 01:44:24,998
'You killed my baby.
She was pregnant.'

1357
01:44:27,064 --> 01:44:28,236
'I'm pregnant.'

1358
01:44:28,599 --> 01:44:30,772
'I want to give birth to this baby.'

1359
01:44:32,470 --> 01:44:35,041
'Guru!'

1360
01:44:38,276 --> 01:44:40,051
My husband is the most kind...

1361
01:44:40,745 --> 01:44:45,057
...truthful and decent
man in the world.

1362
01:44:46,484 --> 01:44:48,054
He would murder someone...

1363
01:44:52,290 --> 01:44:53,564
That's impossible.

1364
01:44:54,158 --> 01:44:56,434
This is Guru's conspiracy.

1365
01:44:57,762 --> 01:45:02,074
Maybe, he killed his wife too.

1366
01:45:03,067 --> 01:45:05,069
And also those women.

1367
01:45:05,536 --> 01:45:06,981
I'm telling you.

1368
01:45:08,039 --> 01:45:09,746
Even the police
are involved in this.

1369
01:45:10,675 --> 01:45:12,279
They are involved with Guru.

1370
01:45:14,545 --> 01:45:18,516
They will kill my husband
and accuse him of everything.

1371
01:45:20,318 --> 01:45:23,128
I beg of you.

1372
01:45:23,788 --> 01:45:25,267
Please save my Rakesh.

1373
01:45:26,524 --> 01:45:27,696
Please save my Rakesh.

1374
01:45:30,127 --> 01:45:31,105
Lord!

1375
01:45:33,597 --> 01:45:36,077
Please send my Rakesh back to me.

1376
01:45:37,368 --> 01:45:39,041
I promise You.

1377
01:45:40,271 --> 01:45:44,242
I will never ask him to leave the house.
I'll never fight with him.

1378
01:45:47,311 --> 01:45:50,520
Please send my Rakesh
back to rne, God!

1379
01:45:58,089 --> 01:45:59,329
I love you, Rakesh.

1380
01:46:02,126 --> 01:46:03,104
Are you listening?

1381
01:46:04,462 --> 01:46:05,736
Please come back home.

1382
01:46:05,796 --> 01:46:06,536
Sulu..

1383
01:46:07,064 --> 01:46:08,634
Wherever you are,
please come home.

1384
01:46:10,634 --> 01:46:12,045
Come back.

1385
01:46:15,272 --> 01:46:16,717
I love you, Rakesh.

1386
01:46:16,774 --> 01:46:18,617
<i>Hove you, Sum.</i>

1387
01:46:20,778 --> 01:46:23,019
Yes, sir. He's been bailed.

1388
01:46:23,347 --> 01:46:25,657
I'll ask him to talk to you.
Hold on, sir.

1389
01:46:25,716 --> 01:46:28,424
Sir, phone.
It's Caesar sir's call, sir.

1390
01:46:33,824 --> 01:46:35,030
Aisha Verma.

1391
01:46:35,693 --> 01:46:39,470
Sai Kripa Society. Versova.

1392
01:46:40,831 --> 01:46:42,504
This was her address, right?

1393
01:46:43,200 --> 01:46:45,373
When I learnt that she's pregnant...

1394
01:46:46,237 --> 01:46:47,716
...l was as happy as a person gets...

1395
01:46:48,038 --> 01:46:50,609
...on knowing about
a buy 1 get 1 free offer.

1396
01:46:51,142 --> 01:46:53,679
Buy a shampoo and
get a soap bar free.

1397
01:46:54,345 --> 01:46:57,622
Kill the mother and the son
or the daughter is killed for free.

1398
01:46:58,315 --> 01:46:59,988
I won't punish you now.

1399
01:47:00,251 --> 01:47:01,423
I'll kill you.

1400
01:47:01,485 --> 01:47:05,365
Sorry, but my life
was on a limited offer.

1401
01:47:06,123 --> 01:47:08,034
Till stocks last only.

1402
01:47:08,526 --> 01:47:10,437
You wanted to play with me.

1403
01:47:11,162 --> 01:47:16,441
But now you'll realise what a big
mistake you made by sparing my life.

1404
01:47:16,767 --> 01:47:21,307
You want to take my Sulo
and my son away from me, right?

1405
01:47:21,372 --> 01:47:25,343
Before that, I'll lake the
rest of your family away from you.

1406
01:47:25,609 --> 01:47:29,580
You like to save people
from being killed by me, right?

1407
01:47:30,247 --> 01:47:31,590
To interfere.

1408
01:47:32,183 --> 01:47:34,060
But you have a strange talent.

1409
01:47:35,186 --> 01:47:36,665
You save the outsiders...

1410
01:47:37,755 --> 01:47:39,098
...but not your family.

1411
01:47:51,669 --> 01:47:54,343
Send police to Aisha's
father's house immediately.

1412
01:47:54,405 --> 01:47:56,248
Rakesh has come to know who I am.

1413
01:47:56,307 --> 01:47:59,117
Save him. I'll do whatever you want.
Just save him.

1414
01:48:19,430 --> 01:48:20,272
Tell me.

1415
01:48:24,635 --> 01:48:25,670
<i>S aw an“!</i>

1416
01:48:26,103 --> 01:48:27,776
Stop! Where are you going? Stop!

1417
01:48:27,838 --> 01:48:29,340
Where are you going?

1418
01:48:30,140 --> 01:48:32,416
Stop! - Stop!

1419
01:48:32,476 --> 01:48:35,480
Hey! Leave him. Let him come.

1420
01:48:44,288 --> 01:48:45,096
Don't kill me.

1421
01:49:21,859 --> 01:49:28,071
Sir, before Guru finds me
and kills me, I want to surrender.

1422
01:49:31,435 --> 01:49:32,573
Where are you right now?

1423
01:49:44,348 --> 01:49:46,760
I've seen many rogues
in my career as a policeman.

1424
01:49:47,084 --> 01:49:48,995
But I've never come
across such an insolent before.

1425
01:49:51,055 --> 01:49:52,534
If he gets away because of me...

1426
01:49:53,791 --> 01:49:55,998
...then neither God, nor
I will be able to forgive myself.

1427
01:49:58,429 --> 01:50:00,204
I've always been
an obstacle for you.

1428
01:50:01,799 --> 01:50:03,608
I've been the villain of your life.

1429
01:50:05,302 --> 01:50:06,713
But I'm saying this to you today.

1430
01:50:07,771 --> 01:50:10,581
Go and kill him.

1431
01:50:12,743 --> 01:50:15,519
He's taking shelter in the
place where he committed the crime.

1432
01:50:17,114 --> 01:50:19,151
He's in Aisha and your house.

1433
01:50:32,296 --> 01:50:33,741
Aisha was wrong.

1434
01:50:39,503 --> 01:50:44,077
I fought death and
got life back for Aisha.

1435
01:50:44,742 --> 01:50:47,188
I got light back into my life.

1436
01:50:50,247 --> 01:50:54,286
But by killing her,
you've spread darkness again.

1437
01:50:58,455 --> 01:50:59,763
Aisha was wrong.

1438
01:51:01,458 --> 01:51:04,132
No lamp can bring
light into this darkness.

1439
01:51:04,194 --> 01:51:07,073
Only the fire of your
pyre can bring light back.

1440
01:51:10,501 --> 01:51:11,775
Aisha was wrong.

1441
01:51:13,470 --> 01:51:15,040
Aisha was wrong.

1442
01:51:16,306 --> 01:51:17,546
Aisha was wrong.

1443
01:51:25,149 --> 01:51:28,756
Please let rne go!
Please forgive rne! Please!

1444
01:51:29,319 --> 01:51:31,230
Please forgive rne! Please!

1445
01:51:31,288 --> 01:51:34,565
Please forgive rne!
Please forgive rne!

1446
01:51:44,168 --> 01:51:47,581
This is what you
wanted to hear, right?

1447
01:51:47,638 --> 01:51:51,142
You wanted me to beg for my
life just as your Aisha did. Right?

1448
01:51:51,775 --> 01:51:54,221
I won't.

1449
01:51:54,812 --> 01:51:58,123
What did you think?
That you found me here?

1450
01:51:59,183 --> 01:51:59,661
No.

1451
01:51:59,717 --> 01:52:02,357
I brought you here.

1452
01:52:03,187 --> 01:52:04,996
I called that policeman.

1453
01:52:05,422 --> 01:52:09,529
I knew that you would get
furious on knowing my whereabouts.

1454
01:52:11,528 --> 01:52:14,407
The place where I killed your wife...

1455
01:52:15,499 --> 01:52:18,036
I knew you would come running to me.

1456
01:52:18,302 --> 01:52:21,181
I made you what I could never be.

1457
01:52:21,238 --> 01:52:22,717
Employee of the year.

1458
01:52:22,773 --> 01:52:24,081
MY Employee.

1459
01:52:27,144 --> 01:52:30,785
If the police had caught me,
I would go to prison.

1460
01:52:32,516 --> 01:52:34,325
All my crimes would be proved.

1461
01:52:35,119 --> 01:52:37,099
My Sulo would have hated me.

1462
01:52:37,154 --> 01:52:40,363
The end of my love story
wouldn't have been a happy one.

1463
01:52:47,564 --> 01:52:49,202
Take this. Take it.

1464
01:52:49,600 --> 01:52:50,305
Kill me.

1465
01:52:50,768 --> 01:52:52,111
You'll kill me...

1466
01:52:52,603 --> 01:52:57,313
...and I'll become
a hero for my Sulo.

1467
01:52:58,242 --> 01:52:59,243
Kill rne!

1468
01:53:01,078 --> 01:53:03,149
Please don't kill me!

1469
01:53:03,580 --> 01:53:05,116
I want to live!

1470
01:53:05,582 --> 01:53:07,528
I'm pregnant!

1471
01:53:08,352 --> 01:53:11,162
I want to give birth to my baby!

1472
01:53:11,755 --> 01:53:13,462
I'm pregnant!

1473
01:53:18,829 --> 01:53:19,671
Look at this.

1474
01:53:20,397 --> 01:53:24,345
You and I are like twin brothers
who were separated in childhood.

1475
01:53:24,768 --> 01:53:25,746
We're the same.

1476
01:53:26,303 --> 01:53:30,115
You want to kill me for your wife.

1477
01:53:30,174 --> 01:53:34,122
And I was killing
everyone for my wife.

1478
01:53:37,581 --> 01:53:42,121
You have no idea what
A big favour you've done on me.

1479
01:53:42,186 --> 01:53:43,688
Because of your revenge story...

1480
01:53:44,254 --> 01:53:49,067
...my Sulo said in front
of everyone that she loves me.

1481
01:53:50,160 --> 01:53:51,537
Thank you, my friend.

1482
01:53:56,733 --> 01:53:58,713
Hello, Guru,
Sir wants to talk to you.

1483
01:54:01,638 --> 01:54:04,084
I threw your wife from here.

1484
01:54:04,141 --> 01:54:05,142
Throw me down.

1485
01:54:05,542 --> 01:54:07,419
Avenge your wife's death.

1486
01:54:08,045 --> 01:54:11,083
Kill me. Let me win.

1487
01:54:11,148 --> 01:54:14,152
Let rne be the hero of
this story and be the villain!

1488
01:54:14,685 --> 01:54:15,629
<i>Rakes!“!</i>

1489
01:54:16,053 --> 01:54:17,054
My husband is not here.

1490
01:54:17,387 --> 01:54:19,389
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

1491
01:54:19,456 --> 01:54:22,027
Mother! - Manish!
Where are you taking my son?

1492
01:54:22,092 --> 01:54:23,230
Mother!

Why are you doing this to us?

1496

Please spare my son!
I beg of you!

1497

Guru.

Rakesh killed your wife.

1499
01:54:35,172 --> 01:54:37,152
What have we done to you?
- I'll kill his wife.

1500
01:54:37,207 --> 01:54:39,687
Sulo! - Please spare my son!

<i>Sum...</i>

<i>Sum...</i>

1517
01:55:24,521 --> 01:55:26,660
Now, it's his son's turn.

1518
01:55:27,357 --> 01:55:30,167
But you'll kill him. I won't.

1519
01:55:31,695 --> 01:55:35,507
I'm waiting for you
at RakesWs house, Guru.

1520
01:55:36,500 --> 01:55:37,535
<i>Come. - sum.</i>

1521

You killed my Sulo.
You killed my Sulo!

You killed my Sulol

You killed my Sulo!

1526
01:56:15,372 --> 01:56:17,113
On this road...

1527
01:56:19,142 --> 01:56:25,286
...this story began.

1528
01:56:28,452 --> 01:56:30,454
Your wife was right.

1529
01:56:31,221 --> 01:56:34,430
Someone would die over here someday.

1530
01:56:35,525 --> 01:56:37,061
On this road...

1531
01:56:37,127 --> 01:56:38,629
<i>...I'll</i> kill <i>you...</i>

1532
01:56:39,129 --> 01:56:44,408
...and bring an end...

1533
01:56:45,302 --> 01:56:48,977
...to this story.

1534
01:56:58,548 --> 01:56:59,993
Who did this?

1535
01:57:00,050 --> 01:57:01,222
I. I didn't do it.

1536
01:57:01,284 --> 01:57:02,991
Can't you drive properly?

1537
01:57:03,420 --> 01:57:04,694
There was a pothole.

1538
01:57:04,755 --> 01:57:06,029
Car lost its balance.

1539
01:57:06,623 --> 01:57:08,432
What happened?

1540
01:57:08,492 --> 01:57:10,733
He is dead.

1541
01:57:33,683 --> 01:57:35,253
'Darkness cannot
drive out darkness.'

1542
01:57:36,420 --> 01:57:38,024
'Only light can do that.'

1543
01:57:42,192 --> 01:57:43,569
'Hate cannot drive out hate.'

1544
01:57:44,494 --> 01:57:45,996
'Only love can do that.'

1545
01:57:49,699 --> 01:57:52,612
'That 8-year-old child who
was under the bed out of fear...'

1546
01:57:53,570 --> 01:57:55,015
'...is still over there.'

1547
01:58:01,445 --> 01:58:03,482
'He only needs someone's hand.'

1548
01:58:06,450 --> 01:58:07,793
'Someone-'s support.'

1549
01:58:14,124 --> 01:58:17,401
'Someone who can pull him out of the
darkness and bring him to light.'

1550
01:58:26,269 --> 01:58:28,715
'Unless we share
someone else's pain...'

1551
01:58:29,539 --> 01:58:33,715
'...we can never relieve
ourselves of pain.'

1552
01:59:32,335 --> 01:59:33,678
Do you want to hear a joke?

1553
01:59:36,239 --> 01:59:37,684
Once, there was a beggar.

1554
01:59:38,141 --> 01:59:40,121
He called up in the five star hotel“

1555
01:59:40,544 --> 01:59:41,545
“and ordered for a burger..

1556
01:59:42,112 --> 01:59:44,615
“pizza and sweet dish.

1557
01:59:45,549 --> 01:59:46,619
Waiter asked him...

1558
01:59:46,683 --> 01:59:47,718
..in whose name
the order shall be placed?

1559
01:59:48,251 --> 01:59:49,423
Beggar said“

1560
01:59:49,753 --> 01:59:50,993
..give it in the name of God.

1561
02:00:05,101 --> 02:00:09,106
"This is where nightfall happens."

"This is where I
have to live and die."

1564
02:00:21,284 --> 02:00:26,495

"You cry over my tears."

1573
02:01:11,568 --> 02:01:16,517
"Someone whispers in my thoughts."

"l feel your presence
even when you're not around."

1575
02:01:21,845 --> 02:01:26,845
"You are the cure to my pain."

02:01:38,495 --> 02:01:43,535
"You're in my prayers."

"What kind of a
relationship do we share?"

"It has no name,
but it's still so deep."

1585
02:02:38,521 --> 02:02:43,334
"These moments are priceless."

1586
02:02:44,027 --> 02:02:48,703
"We might lose them."

1587
02:02:48,765 --> 02:02:53,765
"Let this moment come to a halt."

00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:54,082
Friends-Strangers..

20
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:56,082
It's all irrelevant.

21
00:03:57,041 --> 00:04:00,207
Actually, there are just
Two kinds of people in the World

22
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:01,291
Winners...

23
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,415
and Losers!

24
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:09,249
And today 6 losers are awaited
on the biggest stage...

25
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:15,249
6 losers who didn't come here
for this applause in the first place.

26
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:19,707
It was I who got them here
from the hazy streets of anonymity.

27
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:26,665
Little knowing what
fate had in store for us.

28
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:28,707
Fate!

29
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:30,624
Fate is a bloody fickle thing -

30
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:32,874
changes sides anytime!

31
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:42,124
Common!

32
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:54,791
Come on, Charlie!

33
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:14,374
Come on.

34
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:15,332
1...

35
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:16,665
Get up Charlie!

36
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:17,916
2...

37
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:28,874
Yeah!

38
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:24,040
Hit! Hit!

39
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:25,624
Hit the gong!

40
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:27,749
Yeah..

41
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:29,332
Huh!

42
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:32,457
Charlie this Bald Bob...

43
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:34,040
is beating the hell out of you!

44
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:37,207
Ah what can I say?
It's an occupational Hazard.

45
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:39,707
But that tree trunk
is thrashing you mercilessly!

46
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:41,351
How on earth are
you enduring such pain?

47
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:44,249
Who's getting thrashed to endure?

48
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:46,332
I get thrashed...

49
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:48,332
so that I can come here everyday...

50
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:50,874
get beaten up everyday...

51
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:52,915
manipulate the odds everyday.

52
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:56,624
Charlie...

53
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,540
You have fixed this fight?

54
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:00,957
You have taken money to lose?

55
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:02,041
From Whom?

56
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:05,457
Charlie!

57
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:06,665
From Mr. Motwani?

58
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,999
He is a really dangerous guy!

59
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,832
Hurry up and go Charlie..
And Fall quickly!

60
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:13,124
Be careful Charlie.

61
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:14,665
Lose and come Tiger!

62
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,999
Don't worry...

63
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:18,790
Charlie.

64
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:20,125
I'll handle it.

65
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:50,249
Hey..

66
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:56,165
Fall Dammit!

67
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,249
Everyone's watching..

68
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,332
Try harder, like you mean it.

69
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:02,415
You want to get thrashed...

70
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,207
for all your money's worth eh?

71
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:06,499
A thief's son...

72
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:08,207
Come on, Charlie.

73
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:09,415
And such honesty?

74
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:15,165
You do know that
everyone here knows...

75
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:16,874
that your father was a thief.

76
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:18,874
A thief's son!

77
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:26,958
Thief!

78
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:37,165
What the hell have you done, Charlie?

79
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,124
If Bob doesn't get up...

80
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:41,624
you will never be able to
fight here again. You know that right?

81
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:43,332
Bob get up...

82
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,332
He won't get up.

83
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:45,207
Won't get up?

84
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:46,457
Which means you..

85
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:47,624
Ehhh...

86
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:48,708
Charlie!

87
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,665
I'm Charlie

88
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:56,707
Real name: Chandramohan
Manohar Sharma.

89
00:09:57,916 --> 00:09:59,999
A topper from Boston University..

90
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:02,332
But a loser by Fate.

91
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:06,665
To earn an honest buck
in this city for me had...

92
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:10,957
not only become difficult,
it had become impossible.

93
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:12,749
Why?

94
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,832
That's a long Story!

95
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,040
The Prestigious Diamond Company,
'Shimmer Diamonds' is...

96
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:32,040
shifting an extremely rare collection
of diamonds for an exhibition...

97
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:33,582
from Pretoria to Antwerp.

98
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:36,082
The security of these priceless
diamonds has been given...

99
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:38,874
to the world-renowned
security firm...

100
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:40,624
Shalimar International!

101
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:43,908
So now the custodian of these diamonds,
is the Owner of Shalimar International...

102
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:45,249
Mr. Charan Grover.

103
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:49,457
Let's take a quick look at
the ongoing live press conference.

104
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:51,790
Thank you... Thank you everybody!

105
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:55,499
Is it true that these diamonds...

106
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:56,983
are coming to Dubai for a night?

107
00:10:57,041 --> 00:11:00,207
Before they reach Antwerp,
on Christmas Eve,

108
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,999
just for one night...

109
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:04,415
these diamonds will
be kept here at the Atlantis,

110
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,124
in the Shalimar.

111
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,915
Private Collectors
in the Grey Market...

112
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,800
have estimated these Diamonds
to be worth about 50 million dollars.

113
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:13,290
It's too less...

114
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:15,124
how can one put a value...

115
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:18,582
on 9 priceless diamonds
of the Mughal Dynasty?

116
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,082
And the same night,
the opening ceremony of the..

117
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:22,999
World Dance Championship
is also being held here right?

118
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:25,582
Absolutely, Shimmer Diamonds has...

119
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:28,915
graciously sponsored the World
Dance Championship Trophy this year.

120
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:32,457
This time around, the trophy
has been made in solid Gold.

121
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:36,415
Ln fact, the copies of these
very diamonds have been set in it.

122
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:40,457
The trophy itself is worth
over a quarter of a million dollars.

123
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:43,915
So you see,
it's a win-win situation for all.

124
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,499
Thank you ladies and gentlemen.

125
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:10,290
It's now Time to go get Jag.

126
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,374
Roll sound.

127
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:15,165
Ha Ha Hee Hee, shot 1, take 1.

128
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,665
Action!

129
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,124
Cut.. cut.. cut.. cut!

130
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:35,499
Who is the stupid bomb guy?

131
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:38,540
He's bursting the wrong bomb at
the wrong time at the wrong place...

132
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:39,625
You go call him.

133
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:41,915
You go call him & get him here!

134
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:45,707
Aye Jag!

135
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:48,415
Jag! Captain Jagmohan Prakash.

136
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,707
Ex Bomb squad.

137
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,957
You Deaf Mule!

138
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:53,499
A soldier gives his
years to his country,

139
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:55,499
Jag gave his ear.

140
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:57,332
The director is calling!

141
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:07,374
What's written in this?
What's written in this?

142
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:09,582
It's written that when
the lady gyrates her hips,

143
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:10,915
then the blast should happen...

144
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,457
The hips gyrated,
but the colorful blasts were wrong!

145
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:16,457
What's the matter Mr. Director?

146
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:17,790
I've been telling you since morning..

147
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:20,249
Oh, oh, open shirt,

148
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:22,749
6 pack abs, dard-e-disco look?

149
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:23,958
On my set?

150
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,457
This is unacceptable.
I've been teaching you since morning,

151
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:29,540
Bomb 2-3-4, Bomb 2-3-4...

152
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:30,749
Bomb 2-3-4.

153
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:33,249
That's what I did
Bomb 2-3, Bomb 2-3

154
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:35,707
Where the hell did 4 go?
On a holiday?

155
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:37,124
- What sir?
- What sir?

156
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:39,165
Are you freaking mad?

157
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,124
Huh?

158
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:43,415
Did your mother drop you
on you head when you were a kid,

159
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,900
that you don't understand anything?

160
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:48,040
Lunatic Son,

161
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:49,374
Lunatic Mother!

162
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:52,999
It's essential that
you know 2 things about

163
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:56,415
One: Jag Worships his mother.

164
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:01,582
Two: Jag gets really pissed off...

165
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:03,749
when someone insults his mother.

166
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:05,957
Lunatic mother!

167
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:07,624
Director Sir!

168
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:11,249
Don't say anything about my mother!

169
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:14,082
Why? Is your mom
the great Mother India?

170
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:15,499
I'm warning you I may hit you.

171
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:17,499
You can hit me.

172
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:20,415
But not on a girl...

173
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,290
Save me.

174
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:25,457
I just want to say one thing to you..

175
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:27,582
Your mother is a lunatic!

176
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:30,457
DIRECTOR Sir!

177
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:42,582
Hey..

178
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:58,332
We are going to kill Grover, right?

179
00:14:58,666 --> 00:14:59,666
No..

180
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:00,999
No, jag.

181
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,624
What?

182
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,957
Charlie you don't want to kill
that one Man who ruined all our lives?

183
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:09,624
Manohar uncle was your dad,
but he was no less of a father to me..

184
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:13,707
Because of this scumbag
he is in jail till today.

185
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:17,832
8 years, since 8 years
I've been waiting for this.

186
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:19,082
Even I have been waiting since 8 years

187
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:23,207
Jag but Timing, timing is everything.

188
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:26,832
Charlie! Just tell me once
where can we find this Grover!

189
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:29,457
If I wanted to kill him,
I would have killed him by Now.

190
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:32,082
Since 8 years I've been following
him everywhere like a shadow!

191
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:33,415
London, Berlin,

192
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,499
Vienna, Paris, New York, everywhere.

193
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:38,790
Charan Grover would have
been dead 7 times by now...

194
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:40,332
but you know what jag?

195
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:44,665
Death is a trivial punishment for him.

196
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,207
Justice will be...

197
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:50,374
when he craves for
death and doesn't get it.

198
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:53,457
I want to destroy him..

199
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:56,624
As much as he destroyed us.

200
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:58,476
So then what are
we waiting for Charlie?

201
00:15:58,541 --> 00:15:59,874
I'm here, you're here.

202
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:01,332
- What else do we need?
- No.

203
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:03,415
We are not the only
ones who want revenge Jag.

204
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:05,832
This vengeance is for all three of us.

205
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:09,082
You're going to take
that fat lump along?

206
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:10,207
Yes Jag!

207
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:11,624
This vengeance is
incomplete without him!

208
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:13,082
- But Charlie?
- Jag...

209
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:15,374
we have to get Tammy...

210
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:18,082
Our Fat Lump!

211
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:38,874
Temhton Irani...

212
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:41,332
the 50 year old chick
magnet of Parsi Colony...

213
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:43,540
& the world's best safe cracker.

214
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:45,082
But Tammy was no Thief.

215
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:48,082
He used to test the
safes in my dad's factory.

216
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:50,543
It's essential that you
know 2 things about Tammy.

217
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:54,540
One; Tammy carries an entire
supermarket in his satchel..

218
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:58,582
And two, there is everything
in this satchel, except money.

219
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:10,790
Tammy Irani...!

220
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:16,499
Scoundrel's wearing loose, baggy shorts
& jogging, hitting on these girls!

221
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:20,165
Come here, Come here and stand.
Here take this money..

222
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:23,582
Hurry up & get me my eggs & bread..

223
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:25,207
Always cribbing!

224
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:26,082
Yes mama!

225
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:27,374
Hurry up & take it!

226
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:28,582
Coming Mamma.

227
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:32,290
Oye my money is in
it be careful with it!

228
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:33,375
Yes mama...

229
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:36,499
Last time a quarter
was unaccounted for,

230
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:39,124
now hurry up and take it rogue!

231
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:52,874
I understand...

232
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:53,958
OK!

233
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,040
We have to break into
the Shalimar security systems...

234
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:59,165
which is the most
advanced in the world...

235
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:01,374
Then we have to crack
the safe within &...

236
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:05,457
then steal the 9 priceless diamonds
from there. Right?

237
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:07,540
Right.

238
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:08,374
Correct?

239
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:10,415
Exactly Tammy..
What utter nonsense..

240
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:11,290
Where are you going?

241
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:14,040
I am going home & the two
of you go to the mental hospital.

242
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:15,582
I told you this fatso
is good for nothing!

243
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:16,786
Who you calling a fatso huh?

244
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:17,915
Who you calling a fatso?

245
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,749
You who else!

246
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:19,957
Aye you deaf Bull!

247
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:22,415
One clip I'll give
you under your ear nah.

248
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,999
Your sound system will
go from Mono to mute.

249
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:25,124
Hey Ronnie!

250
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:26,749
Hey Ronnie did my boy come here?

251
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:28,999
Did you see that Idiot?
Hide me Charlie. Hide me!

252
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:30,707
Where the hell is he?

253
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:33,790
You know that rogue has
absconded with 22 rupees of mine!

254
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:38,040
Oh shit!

255
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,124
This lump still gets these fits!

256
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:41,708
Aye fatso!

257
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:43,415
He's not got himself treated yet.

258
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,874
Don't worry, he gets these
fits whenever he's stressed,

259
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,082
but just for 30 seconds.

260
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:50,582
If he comes you tell him,
his mother was remembering him.

261
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:51,832
I'm going to smack him!

262
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:55,624
27,28,29,30!

263
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:00,082
Bye, see you..

264
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:01,290
Aye Tammy..

265
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:06,915
This is our only chance
to get even with Grover.

266
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:09,707
Despite being innocent, dad's...

267
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:12,207
been in jail for the past 8 years.

268
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:17,957
I will give my life
for Manohar you know that.

269
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:21,790
He was my best friend Charlie,
he was my best friend.

270
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:24,249
And if he wasn't in jail today...

271
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:26,540
all of us would
have been working together.

272
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:29,290
That's what I'm asking of you,
to work together.

273
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:33,165
Like how dad and you together
made the Shalimar safe,

274
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:35,415
& during testing
only one man opened...

275
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,249
it without knowing the combination,

276
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:39,499
in 22 minutes.

277
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:41,582
You Tammy!

278
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:43,624
Don't do this for me...

279
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:46,915
do this for dad please.

280
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:50,540
Aye Tammy?

281
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:53,874
Guys I have to pack my bag don't I?

282
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:56,165
Come on!

283
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,250
Take this!

284
00:19:57,708 --> 00:19:58,874
Go Die!

285
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:00,290
Where is he? Where is he?

286
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:02,665
Mama, I told you
to pack my suitcase...

287
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:03,832
not throw it out!

288
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:05,957
Yes I'm your father's slave is it?

289
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:07,957
Take this, your undies and boxers,

290
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:08,832
I've washed it and kept it ready.

291
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,790
Why are you embarrassing
me in front of everyone mama?

292
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:13,374
And listen,
wash your undies before you wear them,

293
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:14,749
wash them everyday,

294
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:16,957
Don't flip it inside out and
wear them else it will get real itchy!

295
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,665
- Keep quiet please!
- Go on now!

296
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,207
Listen you better
go pee before you sleep..

297
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:22,374
Aye mamma!

298
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:24,378
Otherwise you'll have
to wash the bed-sheets too.

299
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:26,040
Can't we live without this fatso?

300
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:26,999
Are the two of us not enough?

301
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:28,582
Even the three of us are not enough.

302
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:30,165
Why? You're putting
together a cricket team?

303
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,540
Jag!

304
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:34,707
Charlie, step on it!

305
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:36,749
Come on hurry.. hurry..

306
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:37,707
Bye, girls.

307
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:40,290
Bye, Tammy.

308
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,249
Now he wants one more person..

309
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:44,165
Why?

310
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,290
Because 3 levels of Shalimar
are completely computerized.

311
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:47,415
We need a hacker.

312
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,207
Ya? Do you know a hacker?

313
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,874
Yes..

314
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,290
He's a friend's nephew called...

315
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:53,415
He's bald?

316
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,874
How is it of any
help to us if he's bald?

317
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:56,540
Arreyy called, not bald!

318
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:58,290
Why haven't you gone to
the doc to clean up your ears?

319
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:00,249
Jag, your nephew, Rohan!

320
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:01,374
- Rohan?
- Hmm..

321
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:04,374
Here goes one more introduction!

322
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,499
And this is Rohan...

323
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:10,874
Aah not this stud...

324
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:12,040
the guy standing behind him.

325
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:15,040
Rohan Singh,
nephew of our Captain Jagmohan!

326
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:17,374
Rohan has 600 friends on Facebook.

327
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:19,207
But not even one in real life.

328
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:22,207
Because IQ doesn't interest girls,
they want CQ..

329
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:23,499
Cool quotient!

330
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:25,124
Don't even try!

331
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:26,457
Dolly & Polly...

332
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:28,790
don't mingle with losers!

333
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:33,374
Oh my god, it's our favorite song!

334
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:37,790
No one knew though that
this loser of the real world..

335
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:42,165
Was HACK-GOD RS of the virtual world.

336
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:48,665
HACK-GOD RS has just
2 things in his life.

337
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:51,582
Number 1 -hacking...

338
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:53,749
and number 2-hacking.

339
00:21:55,750 --> 00:22:00,582
What are you playing?
I didn't.. What is this?

340
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:03,707
- Stop.. stop..
- Hold on.

341
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:06,832
You are such a loser.

342
00:22:06,916 --> 00:22:08,415
Come on, let's go.

343
00:22:08,666 --> 00:22:09,957
Jerk.

344
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:23,790
Save me..

345
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:25,540
Please, save me!

346
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:27,540
I think I've seen this scene before..

347
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:29,165
Hmm.. from the film 'Damini'

348
00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:30,957
Ahh that '2.5 kg fist' scene,
yes.. yes!

349
00:22:31,041 --> 00:22:32,999
Now see Jag's 5 Kg fist.

350
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:35,165
Hey, Jag Uncle!

351
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:36,749
So happy to see you!

352
00:22:36,916 --> 00:22:37,707
Come here.

353
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:38,791
Hey big guy!

354
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:40,124
Leave the kid alone!

355
00:22:42,916 --> 00:22:44,040
Peter!

356
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,540
Thank you.

357
00:22:48,625 --> 00:22:49,957
Come to mama honey.

358
00:22:50,041 --> 00:22:50,874
What?

359
00:22:50,958 --> 00:22:52,457
He said your mother is Horny!

360
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:56,665
What did you say?

361
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:58,207
Come to mama honey!

362
00:22:59,916 --> 00:23:02,249
You called my Mother Horny?

363
00:23:02,291 --> 00:23:03,582
Whose mother?

364
00:23:04,291 --> 00:23:05,291
You?

365
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:09,290
Sleeves?

366
00:23:19,458 --> 00:23:22,790
It's past my dinner time,
my sugar levels are dropping!

367
00:23:27,416 --> 00:23:28,624
I swear on my mom I
didn't take your mother's...

368
00:23:28,708 --> 00:23:31,124
You are talking about my mother again!

369
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:36,665
Rascal You ate my banana?

370
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:39,249
This is the only place you
found in the whole damn street?

371
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:40,874
Go there and fall!

372
00:23:41,291 --> 00:23:41,874
Sorry uncle!

373
00:23:41,958 --> 00:23:42,958
Shut up!

374
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:45,183
See this.
Awesome what is this network?

375
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,957
Will tell you later,
first tell me, can you hack it?

376
00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:51,415
See, Charlie, this is
an extremely secure network,

377
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,100
if I start working
on it tomorrow then...

378
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:55,249
I'm telling you Rohan,
this work is illegal.

379
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:56,415
Haaan!

380
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:02,915
Pinky, Pamma,

381
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,374
Bubbly, Lovely,

382
00:24:04,458 --> 00:24:06,624
Sweety, Tinny.

383
00:24:13,333 --> 00:24:15,749
Mammaiya Kairo Kairo Kairo mamaa..

384
00:24:15,791 --> 00:24:16,415
Kairo mamaa!

385
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:21,749
Mammaiya Kairo Kairo Kairo mamaa..

386
00:24:21,833 --> 00:24:24,457
Guys, don't say 'Mamma'..
He will hit us!

387
00:24:30,625 --> 00:24:32,957
What's there what's
there what's there?

388
00:24:33,041 --> 00:24:33,749
Aah..

389
00:24:33,833 --> 00:24:36,290
Strawberry milk shake, yeah!

390
00:24:37,833 --> 00:24:39,957
Peter! You've come back?

391
00:24:51,041 --> 00:24:53,290
Why do you keep falling next to me?

392
00:24:53,375 --> 00:24:56,165
What should I do uncle?
He keeps throwing me here!

393
00:24:57,208 --> 00:24:58,707
Jaswinder!

394
00:24:59,583 --> 00:25:03,915
Jaswinder!

395
00:25:22,166 --> 00:25:24,374
*&^%$♪♪***^&^&^

396
00:25:24,458 --> 00:25:25,832
MAATAJI!!

397
00:25:26,416 --> 00:25:27,040
What did he say?

398
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:29,457
Damn he abused your mom in Chinese!

399
00:25:38,416 --> 00:25:40,249
MAATAJI!!

400
00:25:41,958 --> 00:25:43,832
This is a really dangerous place.

401
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:46,415
A person can't even eat in peace.

402
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,290
What's there what's
there what's there?

403
00:25:50,375 --> 00:25:52,582
Ah Pineapple cake!

404
00:25:52,666 --> 00:25:55,374
I am gonna have my
cake and eat it too.

405
00:25:56,666 --> 00:25:57,790
Ooii Maa!

406
00:25:57,875 --> 00:25:58,790
Maa?

407
00:25:58,875 --> 00:26:01,874
We've said that you work
for us in our software company...

408
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:17,374
Peter?

409
00:26:17,958 --> 00:26:19,582
Is that you?

410
00:26:20,708 --> 00:26:22,290
Peek-a-Boo!

411
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:25,790
Jag uncle, help him!

412
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:26,875
OK. OK..

413
00:26:27,291 --> 00:26:28,665
Jaaagggg!

414
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,290
They are saying your mother..

415
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:36,415
Your mother is a $♪@**!

416
00:26:40,708 --> 00:26:42,249
Maa always works!

417
00:27:01,375 --> 00:27:04,790
I've understood the plan it's
All clear! But there is one problem.

418
00:27:04,875 --> 00:27:06,415
I will hack the
computers of this vault...

419
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,582
but how will you
guys get inside the vault?

420
00:27:08,666 --> 00:27:10,207
There is a biometric lock there.

421
00:27:10,291 --> 00:27:11,832
Aye hacker, talk in layman terms!

422
00:27:11,916 --> 00:27:14,790
What he means is, the door
of the room that this vault is in...

423
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:16,124
opens only with fingerprints.

424
00:27:16,791 --> 00:27:18,082
Actually...

425
00:27:18,833 --> 00:27:20,915
with the thumbprint
of just one Man.

426
00:27:20,958 --> 00:27:21,958
Who's thumbprint?

427
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,290
His thumbprint.

428
00:27:24,291 --> 00:27:26,207
Vicky Grover, Charan Grover's son?

429
00:27:27,291 --> 00:27:28,665
- Vicky Grover?
- Yeah!

430
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:31,165
Vicky Grover?

431
00:27:31,375 --> 00:27:32,707
Peter?

432
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:33,624
We will take it from here.

433
00:27:33,666 --> 00:27:34,832
Okay!

434
00:27:34,916 --> 00:27:37,457
Come on, Charlie, it's a bloody joke.

435
00:27:37,791 --> 00:27:39,540
Come on, Tammy, don't over react.

436
00:27:39,625 --> 00:27:40,457
I Have a plan.

437
00:27:40,541 --> 00:27:41,165
Plan?

438
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:42,999
You intend on roping
in Vikki Grover?

439
00:27:43,833 --> 00:27:46,332
Actually, yes, something of that sort.

440
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:53,790
Radhe! Radhe!

441
00:27:53,875 --> 00:27:55,540
Hail Lord Krishna!

442
00:27:55,625 --> 00:27:57,290
Radhe! Radhe!

443
00:27:57,375 --> 00:27:59,290
Hail Lord Krishna!

444
00:28:00,166 --> 00:28:02,290
Nandu Bhide is The Man!!!

445
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:30,915
Hey, where is Nandu's bottle?!

446
00:28:51,666 --> 00:28:54,207
Guys! I present to you...
Vikki Grover!

447
00:28:54,416 --> 00:28:55,832
Aka Nandu Bhide!

448
00:28:56,458 --> 00:28:58,624
Bloody hell, Double role!

449
00:28:58,958 --> 00:29:00,874
Oh My God! It's like a movie!

450
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:05,165
Where did you find him?

451
00:29:05,541 --> 00:29:07,290
Last year I saw him in the Ram-Leela.

452
00:29:07,375 --> 00:29:09,040
He was playing the
role of Lord Hanuman.

453
00:29:09,125 --> 00:29:10,457
I saw Ram-Leela once...

454
00:29:10,541 --> 00:29:12,165
& got blessings for a lifetime!

455
00:29:12,416 --> 00:29:13,790
- Superb, Charlie.
- Bless me!

456
00:29:13,875 --> 00:29:15,082
So be it!

457
00:29:17,625 --> 00:29:25,625
Have the liquor and break the pot.

458
00:29:28,541 --> 00:29:30,999
It's essential that you know
two things about Nandu Bhide..

459
00:29:31,083 --> 00:29:32,207
One.

460
00:29:32,458 --> 00:29:34,332
He can throw up anytime.

461
00:29:34,375 --> 00:29:36,499
Jump up anytime?
Is he a gymnast?

462
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:38,832
Not jump up... Throw up!

463
00:29:39,083 --> 00:29:40,540
And the second thing?

464
00:29:41,291 --> 00:29:42,749
Second thing?

465
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:44,665
See it for yourself.

466
00:29:48,916 --> 00:29:52,249
Nandu, no.

467
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:54,874
Oh God.

468
00:30:02,416 --> 00:30:04,540
Control.

469
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:18,124
Waste of time, guys!
How can we trust him?

470
00:30:18,208 --> 00:30:19,124
He will ruin the entire plan!

471
00:30:19,208 --> 00:30:20,832
Without him there is no plan!

472
00:30:21,208 --> 00:30:23,707
If we want to get into
Shalimar then we need this face.

473
00:30:23,791 --> 00:30:25,082
This one, this.

474
00:30:25,875 --> 00:30:27,374
Ewwww..

475
00:30:27,791 --> 00:30:29,874
Guys, We need him!

476
00:30:29,958 --> 00:30:31,332
- Feed him?
- No, Not feed him.

477
00:30:31,416 --> 00:30:32,999
But why should we feed him?

478
00:30:33,083 --> 00:30:35,290
Look, he's so hopelessly drunk!

479
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:36,375
What do you guys think?

480
00:30:36,416 --> 00:30:38,165
He will risk his life for us?

481
00:30:38,208 --> 00:30:39,999
- Never!
- Exactly!

482
00:30:40,083 --> 00:30:41,790
He has no reason to.

483
00:30:41,875 --> 00:30:43,540
Charlie, No motivation.

484
00:30:43,625 --> 00:30:44,499
No crime!

485
00:30:44,583 --> 00:30:46,207
Furthermore, he is so useless...

486
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:48,540
and he really stinks, Charlie.

487
00:30:48,625 --> 00:30:51,124
How do we make a gentleman
out of this trash?

488
00:30:51,208 --> 00:30:53,582
Charlie, I've heard about
sex change operations...

489
00:30:53,666 --> 00:30:56,040
but a species change
operation is impossible!

490
00:30:56,083 --> 00:30:56,707
Tammy!

491
00:30:56,791 --> 00:30:58,915
It's impossible, doctor!

492
00:30:59,333 --> 00:31:02,374
An operation without
money is impossible!

493
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,290
I know that..

494
00:31:05,375 --> 00:31:08,540
I will save up the
money in 1 -2 years though!

495
00:31:09,041 --> 00:31:11,540
But where is the time, Nandu?

496
00:31:12,166 --> 00:31:15,624
Mom won't survive for 1 -2 years...

497
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:18,290
6 months.

498
00:31:19,083 --> 00:31:21,207
And if it gets later than that...

499
00:31:24,041 --> 00:31:25,749
Hey, Mom, you don't worry okay!

500
00:31:25,833 --> 00:31:27,332
Don't you worry.

501
00:31:27,666 --> 00:31:29,624
Nandu will collect the money.

502
00:31:29,791 --> 00:31:32,207
Nandu will get your tumor operated.

503
00:31:32,666 --> 00:31:36,040
Hey you rich, wealthy people!

504
00:31:36,083 --> 00:31:38,707
Hang up your pots, as high as you can!

505
00:31:38,791 --> 00:31:41,249
Nandu will get them.

506
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:44,040
I'll get them!

507
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,832
Poor Nandu!

508
00:31:53,333 --> 00:31:55,040
His mom has a tumor.

509
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,332
But guys we now have a reason...

510
00:31:58,125 --> 00:32:00,082
his mother's operation.

511
00:32:01,125 --> 00:32:02,499
Here's to motivation guys.

512
00:32:02,541 --> 00:32:04,374
Cheers to Nandu!

513
00:32:08,333 --> 00:32:09,457
Team Diamonds!

514
00:32:09,625 --> 00:32:10,999
A Drunken Wastrel...

515
00:32:11,083 --> 00:32:12,207
A Wild Boar...

516
00:32:12,291 --> 00:32:13,540
A Heavy Duty Soldier...

517
00:32:13,625 --> 00:32:15,124
And an impish Kid!

518
00:32:15,541 --> 00:32:18,207
I had carefully handpicked these...

519
00:32:18,458 --> 00:32:20,165
Charlie's Angels!

520
00:32:26,208 --> 00:32:27,957
This is Manohar's old workshop!

521
00:32:28,041 --> 00:32:29,790
We used to work here years ago..

522
00:32:29,875 --> 00:32:30,790
Hey, Jag?

523
00:32:30,875 --> 00:32:32,207
Remember this Lathe Machine?

524
00:32:32,291 --> 00:32:34,999
I can't believe it.
Everything is still the same, Tammy.

525
00:32:35,083 --> 00:32:38,624
Hmm. The Destruction
of Charan Grover should begin..

526
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:41,374
Where is left us destroyed.

527
00:32:43,166 --> 00:32:44,832
We begin our work today, guys.

528
00:32:44,916 --> 00:32:47,124
But what are we going to do here?

529
00:32:49,833 --> 00:32:50,957
Rehearsal!

530
00:32:52,291 --> 00:32:55,582
Rehearsal of the
World's grandest heist!

531
00:33:04,791 --> 00:33:06,540
We are going to rob this cupboard?

532
00:33:11,416 --> 00:33:13,082
Abode of the underground Goddess!

533
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:23,707
Ladies...

534
00:33:24,458 --> 00:33:26,082
welcome to Shalimar!

535
00:33:26,375 --> 00:33:27,707
Gentlemen!

536
00:33:27,916 --> 00:33:29,540
Welcome to Shalimar!

537
00:33:31,083 --> 00:33:31,915
First point...

538
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,915
Shalimar's 100 feet long corridor.

539
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,165
At the very entrance we have...

540
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:38,665
specially trained
Black-Cat commandos.

541
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:40,040
They kill first...

542
00:33:40,125 --> 00:33:41,707
and doubt later.

543
00:33:41,791 --> 00:33:45,624
These commando's are trained
by the Mossad or the KGB.

544
00:33:45,708 --> 00:33:48,749
And Nandu will go through
this very corridor.

545
00:33:49,166 --> 00:33:50,624
What? What? What?

546
00:33:50,875 --> 00:33:53,457
You think I am these
big brutes brother in law...

547
00:33:53,541 --> 00:33:55,540
that they will let me go in?

548
00:33:55,625 --> 00:33:56,999
No! Not their brother in law..

549
00:33:57,083 --> 00:33:59,790
They will think you are Vikki Grover.

550
00:34:00,833 --> 00:34:02,040
- Meaning?
- Tammy?

551
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:04,915
Charan Grover's son.

552
00:34:08,291 --> 00:34:10,957
Damn double role.

553
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:14,124
Same to same, color Xerox!

554
00:34:15,208 --> 00:34:18,124
How's it possible though?
My dad never went to Dubai.

555
00:34:19,458 --> 00:34:21,624
His dad must have come to India!

556
00:34:21,875 --> 00:34:24,374
Yes that's possible...

557
00:34:25,541 --> 00:34:26,582
Hey!

558
00:34:28,375 --> 00:34:30,832
This is the biometric security.

559
00:34:31,291 --> 00:34:34,249
This lock can open with
the fingerprints of just one man.

560
00:34:34,333 --> 00:34:35,165
And he is...

561
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:36,415
Grover!

562
00:34:37,791 --> 00:34:39,249
Vikki Grover!

563
00:34:39,333 --> 00:34:40,665
The key to Shalimar!

564
00:34:40,916 --> 00:34:42,707
- Wassup daddy cool?
- All well!

565
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,915
Vikki Grover.

566
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,874
Now where will we get Vikki
Grover's fingerprints from!

567
00:34:53,208 --> 00:34:54,749
That's not a big problem.

568
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,540
The big problem is,

569
00:34:56,875 --> 00:34:59,874
how are we going to transform
Nandu into Vikki Grover?

570
00:35:02,583 --> 00:35:04,374
Mission impossible.

571
00:35:14,083 --> 00:35:15,540
Such a big safe?

572
00:35:15,625 --> 00:35:16,499
Hmm..

573
00:35:16,583 --> 00:35:18,040
Tammy's true Love!

574
00:35:18,125 --> 00:35:19,125
Shalimar!

575
00:35:22,958 --> 00:35:26,332
"My true love,"

576
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,915
"Shalimar.."

577
00:35:30,916 --> 00:35:34,624
"Until we meet..."

578
00:35:35,125 --> 00:35:38,540
"...we both are restless."

579
00:35:38,833 --> 00:35:41,165
"Ln our eyes the wait is endless."

580
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:44,624
49 levers, 7 cycles,

581
00:35:44,708 --> 00:35:46,457
145 tumblers.

582
00:35:46,541 --> 00:35:47,707
- Stop Tammy!
- What happened?

583
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:51,124
In the real Shalimar,
there is an outer laser shield...

584
00:35:51,458 --> 00:35:53,040
which is 12000 volts.

585
00:35:58,375 --> 00:36:02,749
The codes to this outer
laser shield are changed everyday!

586
00:36:10,916 --> 00:36:12,749
Who's going to stop
this electric current now?

587
00:36:12,916 --> 00:36:14,082
My father?

588
00:36:14,166 --> 00:36:15,665
But he never went to Dubai did he.

589
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:17,457
Hey you listen,
Don't go on my dad!

590
00:36:17,541 --> 00:36:18,541
Guys.. guys.. Nandu?

591
00:36:18,583 --> 00:36:19,749
- Tammy?
- Sorry!

592
00:36:19,833 --> 00:36:21,457
The laser-shield is computerized.

593
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:23,874
So it will be hacko-fied!

594
00:36:23,958 --> 00:36:24,665
Yaaaooo!

595
00:36:24,916 --> 00:36:26,457
So, gentlemen!

596
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:30,290
This is the world
famous Shalimar safe.

597
00:36:30,666 --> 00:36:33,540
It has more than 110
million combinations!

598
00:36:33,625 --> 00:36:35,499
110 million!

599
00:36:35,583 --> 00:36:37,415
If you start trying today...

600
00:36:37,791 --> 00:36:40,290
It will be 350 years before you've...

601
00:36:40,541 --> 00:36:42,957
tried all combinations,

602
00:36:43,416 --> 00:36:45,124
and it still won't open.

603
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,332
Mr. Gupta?

604
00:37:00,208 --> 00:37:01,540
Would you step in, please?

605
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:11,040
So to open Shalimar without the codes,
it will take you 350 years.

606
00:37:11,333 --> 00:37:13,040
But you will have only...

607
00:37:13,125 --> 00:37:14,457
5 minutes.

608
00:37:14,708 --> 00:37:17,499
The door of the safe will
remain open for just 5 minutes.

609
00:37:17,708 --> 00:37:20,749
And in these 5 minutes, If we
don't escape with the diamonds then..

610
00:37:20,833 --> 00:37:21,374
Then?

611
00:37:21,458 --> 00:37:24,749
The door will automatically shut
and the laser shield will come on!

612
00:37:25,708 --> 00:37:26,999
Oye.. oyeeee!

613
00:37:27,083 --> 00:37:29,290
Step back. Please.
Thank you so much.

614
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:35,499
Which means even if somehow
a thief comes in, he has no way out!

615
00:37:38,541 --> 00:37:39,541
Mister Gupta?

616
00:37:39,625 --> 00:37:41,249
There is oxygen inside..

617
00:37:41,291 --> 00:37:42,707
Keep breathing.

618
00:37:43,416 --> 00:37:45,582
As you can see, apart from me...

619
00:37:45,666 --> 00:37:47,749
no one can take out your
diamonds from Shalimar.

620
00:37:48,125 --> 00:37:49,499
And trust me...

621
00:37:49,583 --> 00:37:50,874
I'm not a thief!

622
00:37:53,333 --> 00:37:55,624
You guys know the way out!

623
00:37:55,708 --> 00:37:57,999
Apart from this,
there is no other way in!

624
00:37:58,083 --> 00:37:59,415
There is a way.

625
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,874
A way...

626
00:38:02,208 --> 00:38:03,957
that even Grover is unaware of.

627
00:38:04,125 --> 00:38:05,290
Which way?

628
00:38:06,416 --> 00:38:10,665
Shalimar is a 150
feet below Atlantis.

629
00:38:11,333 --> 00:38:14,165
And this is where the sewer
system of Atlantis is as well.

630
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,250
So-oar?

631
00:38:15,375 --> 00:38:17,082
Sewer as in a gutter!

632
00:38:17,291 --> 00:38:18,999
Not a dirty pig like you!

633
00:38:19,125 --> 00:38:22,540
Shalimar's greatest
weakness is its ventilation!

634
00:38:22,791 --> 00:38:23,957
Meaning?

635
00:38:24,583 --> 00:38:25,374
Air flow.

636
00:38:25,458 --> 00:38:26,290
It's tight!

637
00:38:26,375 --> 00:38:29,249
There was an old A/C
duct here for air supply.

638
00:38:29,375 --> 00:38:30,915
One vent of this duct is still...

639
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,200
somewhere behind the panel,
in the walls of Shalimar.

640
00:38:33,375 --> 00:38:35,582
Me and Tammy will
reach behind this panel...

641
00:38:35,666 --> 00:38:38,165
and Nandu you, disguised
as Vikki will open this panel...

642
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:39,707
so both of us can come in.

643
00:38:39,916 --> 00:38:40,957
How?

644
00:38:41,208 --> 00:38:43,124
With this Allen Key,

645
00:38:43,208 --> 00:38:45,290
I mean with this Key, Nandu.

646
00:38:45,958 --> 00:38:47,499
There are special grooves in this,

647
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:49,582
with which the panel
will open with ease.

648
00:38:50,125 --> 00:38:51,582
Where did you get this from?

649
00:39:03,916 --> 00:39:06,165
In the thousands of
hands that made Shalimar..

650
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:07,624
There were also those 2 hands,

651
00:39:07,708 --> 00:39:10,582
that were mapping & plotting
the destruction of Grover.

652
00:39:15,958 --> 00:39:17,874
Aye Charlie, you are a genius!

653
00:39:17,958 --> 00:39:19,124
Superb!

654
00:39:20,208 --> 00:39:21,249
Alright.

655
00:39:22,166 --> 00:39:24,665
Thank you, Nandu. That's enough.

656
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:26,207
Okay, Charlie...

657
00:39:26,375 --> 00:39:28,957
How will the two of us reach
the other side of the panel?

658
00:39:29,166 --> 00:39:31,999
We will reach the other side
of the panel through the AC duct.

659
00:39:32,083 --> 00:39:36,540
See, the AC duct begins here,
and comes till here.

660
00:39:36,625 --> 00:39:38,374
Years ago,
these used to be pump rooms..

661
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,582
For air conditioning.

662
00:39:39,666 --> 00:39:42,124
But now these rooms have
been renovated into green rooms..

663
00:39:42,208 --> 00:39:44,290
For live events, performances
that are held here at the Atlantis.

664
00:39:44,375 --> 00:39:47,499
So this AC duct has
one opening here...

665
00:39:47,583 --> 00:39:48,999
and the other opening is...

666
00:39:49,083 --> 00:39:51,332
here, in Room 9C.

667
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,082
There are 1539 rooms in Atlantis..

668
00:39:55,625 --> 00:39:58,665
But there is only one
way to get into Shalimar,

669
00:39:59,125 --> 00:40:00,624
and that is through...

670
00:40:01,166 --> 00:40:02,415
Room 9C.

671
00:40:04,083 --> 00:40:04,999
Perfect!

672
00:40:05,083 --> 00:40:07,915
So, we will go to Atlantis, Book 9C...

673
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,915
and directly check
into the Shalimar!

674
00:40:10,208 --> 00:40:11,415
Correct?

675
00:40:12,458 --> 00:40:13,458
Errr..

676
00:40:14,625 --> 00:40:15,249
Actually..

677
00:40:15,333 --> 00:40:16,874
It's not that simple, Tammy.

678
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:20,040
The thing is...

679
00:40:20,125 --> 00:40:22,665
Room 9C is already reserved.

680
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:23,957
Reserved?

681
00:40:24,291 --> 00:40:25,332
6 months in advance?

682
00:40:25,416 --> 00:40:26,416
Yes.. No..

683
00:40:26,625 --> 00:40:28,999
I.. No.. Not exactly like that...

684
00:40:29,083 --> 00:40:31,290
Charlie, I've understood!

685
00:40:31,541 --> 00:40:33,415
The thing is, another group...

686
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,665
has already made the
same plan and have booked it!

687
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:36,457
No issues!

688
00:40:36,541 --> 00:40:38,249
We'll meet this guys and
tell them to split 50-50 with us...

689
00:40:38,333 --> 00:40:39,665
or we'll call the cops!

690
00:40:39,958 --> 00:40:41,832
No. No. No.
This room cannot be booked.

691
00:40:41,916 --> 00:40:42,874
So then how is it reserved?

692
00:40:42,958 --> 00:40:45,207
Guys I told you'll it's a green room.

693
00:40:45,458 --> 00:40:48,124
If its green or if its black,
how does the color matter to us?

694
00:40:48,375 --> 00:40:49,935
We aren't going there
for our honeymoon?

695
00:40:50,166 --> 00:40:51,790
Charlie boy?

696
00:40:52,375 --> 00:40:53,957
What's cooking?

697
00:40:55,333 --> 00:40:56,832
What are you hiding from us?

698
00:40:57,833 --> 00:40:59,832
It's nothing dude, nothing at all..

699
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:00,916
You guys.. okay...

700
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:02,290
okay so the thing is...

701
00:41:02,375 --> 00:41:04,707
the night the
diamonds are in the Shalimar..

702
00:41:04,791 --> 00:41:07,832
That night there is a live
event in Atlantis, a performance.

703
00:41:07,916 --> 00:41:09,249
WDC.

704
00:41:09,541 --> 00:41:12,082
And Room 9c is reserved...

705
00:41:12,166 --> 00:41:13,499
for WDC.

706
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:15,665
And if we want Room
9C for ourselves...

707
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:18,207
then we have to take part in WDC.

708
00:41:18,291 --> 00:41:18,874
That's it!

709
00:41:18,958 --> 00:41:20,415
Dabboo DC.. Dabboo DC..

710
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,832
Dabboo DC what the
hell is this Dabboo DC?

711
00:41:23,333 --> 00:41:23,957
WDC.

712
00:41:24,041 --> 00:41:25,041
Yes that what is it?

713
00:41:25,125 --> 00:41:27,540
Guys, I told you its
a live performance...

714
00:41:27,625 --> 00:41:29,582
you know it's an event WDC..

715
00:41:29,666 --> 00:41:31,457
Wordanchamship.

716
00:41:32,458 --> 00:41:33,874
Excuse me.

717
00:41:34,166 --> 00:41:35,957
He's already deaf...

718
00:41:36,166 --> 00:41:38,040
and we didn't
hear you all that well either.

719
00:41:38,333 --> 00:41:38,874
What did you say?

720
00:41:38,958 --> 00:41:39,832
Didn't hear?

721
00:41:39,916 --> 00:41:42,082
Nothing it's just a...

722
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:44,332
What is a ...?

723
00:41:44,416 --> 00:41:46,582
It's a ...!

724
00:41:46,666 --> 00:41:49,082
What is a ...?

725
00:41:49,166 --> 00:41:50,082
Say it clearly!

726
00:41:50,166 --> 00:41:51,499
World Dance Championship.

727
00:41:51,833 --> 00:41:53,832
Go H^%* a buffalo!

728
00:41:54,708 --> 00:41:55,874
Sajid Sir!

729
00:41:56,208 --> 00:41:57,790
Is your new film starting?

730
00:41:58,041 --> 00:41:59,707
Guys its!

731
00:42:00,166 --> 00:42:00,832
GUYS?

732
00:42:00,916 --> 00:42:02,124
Director Sir! Jag here!

733
00:42:02,208 --> 00:42:03,728
I've memorized the
sequence perfectly -

734
00:42:03,791 --> 00:42:04,707
Bomb 2,3,4!

735
00:42:04,791 --> 00:42:05,624
Bomb 2, 3, 4!

736
00:42:05,708 --> 00:42:07,665
Hello sir I can't hear you too well?

737
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:09,230
Now I'll have to go say sorry to mom!

738
00:42:09,291 --> 00:42:10,874
Mummy, I am sorry!
Aye Drama Queens!

739
00:42:10,958 --> 00:42:13,415
Aye! What this drama for guys?

740
00:42:14,375 --> 00:42:16,082
It's a small, tiny dance competition.

741
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:16,957
That's it!

742
00:42:17,041 --> 00:42:19,207
What do you mean by that's it!

743
00:42:19,291 --> 00:42:20,707
This is not a dance competition...

744
00:42:20,791 --> 00:42:22,415
this is the World
Dance Competition.

745
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:23,415
Ya so?

746
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:24,415
So?

747
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,957
Who amongst us
looks like a dancer to you?

748
00:42:26,041 --> 00:42:27,665
This fatso?
This drunkard? Or this kid?

749
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:28,249
Hey?

750
00:42:28,333 --> 00:42:30,124
Forgot to mention yourself huh,
Jackson's illegitimate child!

751
00:42:30,208 --> 00:42:31,374
Why you calling me Macmohan?

752
00:42:31,458 --> 00:42:32,832
We'll discuss this later...

753
00:42:32,916 --> 00:42:34,207
First you tell us,

754
00:42:34,291 --> 00:42:38,040
how on earth are we going to
reach this World Dance Championship.

755
00:42:39,083 --> 00:42:40,083
As team India!

756
00:42:40,208 --> 00:42:41,415
Superb!

757
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,082
Aye, Tammy, listen up.

758
00:42:43,166 --> 00:42:45,207
This time WDC, India
is happening here.

759
00:42:45,291 --> 00:42:46,291
In Mumbai.

760
00:42:46,375 --> 00:42:49,957
And to win that, it's not
essential for us to dance well.

761
00:42:50,041 --> 00:42:51,374
We just have to go on stage...

762
00:42:51,458 --> 00:42:53,874
and move around
a bit that's all guys!

763
00:42:53,958 --> 00:42:55,707
Yes! And end up making
an absolute fool...

764
00:42:55,791 --> 00:42:57,374
out of ourselves in front of
the entire country.

765
00:42:57,458 --> 00:42:58,458
Nope..

766
00:42:58,500 --> 00:42:59,874
We will emerge victorious!

767
00:42:59,958 --> 00:43:01,874
Correct, we will look ridiculous!

768
00:43:02,125 --> 00:43:03,582
Idiot.

769
00:43:03,916 --> 00:43:06,790
The winner of WDC India
will be decided by Votes..

770
00:43:07,333 --> 00:43:10,707
And we will automatically
get the maximum votes.

771
00:43:10,791 --> 00:43:11,999
From Where?

772
00:43:12,375 --> 00:43:13,540
From here!

773
00:43:14,583 --> 00:43:15,707
Rohan?

774
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,207
I'm pointing towards you.

775
00:43:17,291 --> 00:43:18,291
Me?

776
00:43:18,625 --> 00:43:23,124
Rohan is going to hack his way in, and
he will get the maximum votes for us.

777
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:24,874
By hacking the votes.

778
00:43:24,958 --> 00:43:27,082
Damn genius.
Why didn't you say before?

779
00:43:27,166 --> 00:43:29,957
I'm saying now, am I not!
That's gonna be easy. I'm in guys!

780
00:43:30,041 --> 00:43:32,832
He too is in guys,
Well done, very good go for it!

781
00:43:32,916 --> 00:43:34,415
He's going to hack his way in...

782
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,999
but we guys can't dance!

783
00:43:37,583 --> 00:43:39,665
Talk about yourself, Khali!

784
00:43:40,291 --> 00:43:44,540
Charlie, My snake dance
is world famous in Sangam Chawl!

785
00:43:44,625 --> 00:43:46,332
I'll show you?
See.. that's the spirit got for it.

786
00:43:46,416 --> 00:43:48,040
- Yeah very good.
- Aye see!

787
00:43:48,416 --> 00:43:50,874
Hey see this,
it's so easy, yeah, yeah!

788
00:43:51,083 --> 00:43:52,249
I rest my case.

789
00:43:52,333 --> 00:43:53,749
Come on, Tammy, Jag!

790
00:43:53,833 --> 00:43:55,749
You guys know that if we
really want to achieve something...

791
00:43:55,833 --> 00:43:57,207
we can easily do it..

792
00:43:57,291 --> 00:43:58,457
And this is just
a little bit of dancing.

793
00:43:58,541 --> 00:44:01,457
We just need a little practice
and we'll get it in a jiffy.. Jiffy.

794
00:44:03,041 --> 00:44:04,540
See, we can do this..

795
00:44:05,375 --> 00:44:06,375
See

796
00:44:08,541 --> 00:44:09,665
Is there more to it, Nandu?

797
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:11,082
No that's all there is.

798
00:44:11,333 --> 00:44:13,207
That's it, guys. Come on. So simple.

799
00:44:14,375 --> 00:44:15,290
Come on, Guys.

800
00:44:15,375 --> 00:44:17,707
Come on, Tammy Come. Okay come!

801
00:44:17,916 --> 00:44:19,999
I got three left feet, Charlie.

802
00:44:20,083 --> 00:44:21,790
More feet better dance!

803
00:46:43,083 --> 00:46:44,165
Right there.

804
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:46,665
"My heart is restless."

805
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,165
"My eyes are waiting."

806
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:51,707
"Life is meaningless.."

807
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,207
"..there's no rhythm."

808
00:46:54,625 --> 00:46:59,332
"Come, beloved. Come on."

809
00:46:59,791 --> 00:47:07,791
"Let's get into tune."

810
00:48:35,333 --> 00:48:37,915
I told Charlie that we
can't dance to save our lives.

811
00:48:38,166 --> 00:48:40,332
I was better off in the army...

812
00:48:40,416 --> 00:48:41,582
Arrey arrey arrey!

813
00:48:41,666 --> 00:48:44,665
We have to go on stage in 2 weeks
and you guys don't know jack shit yet!

814
00:48:44,750 --> 00:48:46,957
What do you know, you piece of thrash?

815
00:48:47,041 --> 00:48:48,124
You called me a piece of thrash?

816
00:48:48,208 --> 00:48:50,874
You tie this bandanna around your neck
and do your snake dance all day long.

817
00:48:50,958 --> 00:48:52,040
You've come for your father's wedding?

818
00:48:52,125 --> 00:48:53,540
Hey don't go on my dad.

819
00:48:53,625 --> 00:48:54,415
What you going to do about it?

820
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:55,540
What will you do?
What will you do?

821
00:48:55,625 --> 00:48:57,305
What will you do fatso?
What will you do?

822
00:48:57,375 --> 00:48:59,582
Here we go again!
What will you do?

823
00:48:59,666 --> 00:49:00,707
Shhhhh!

824
00:49:00,791 --> 00:49:02,082
No one has to do anything.

825
00:49:02,291 --> 00:49:03,374
Whatever needs to be done,
Rohan's going to do.

826
00:49:03,458 --> 00:49:04,624
Rohan's going to
take care of the votes.

827
00:49:04,708 --> 00:49:05,957
We won't get voted out.

828
00:49:06,791 --> 00:49:07,624
Dancing is not a tension.

829
00:49:07,708 --> 00:49:09,124
Uh-actually...

830
00:49:09,208 --> 00:49:10,332
there is tension.

831
00:49:10,416 --> 00:49:12,790
This time a lot of
teams have applied so...

832
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,499
there is a judges round
before the actual competition.

833
00:49:15,583 --> 00:49:17,832
We are your worst nightmares!

834
00:49:17,916 --> 00:49:19,582
This competition is no joke!

835
00:49:19,666 --> 00:49:20,915
We will choose only the best!

836
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,249
And eliminate the rest!

837
00:49:23,666 --> 00:49:25,457
M%*^@$>!

838
00:49:25,916 --> 00:49:26,916
Chuck it, guys!

839
00:49:30,875 --> 00:49:33,415
Guys remove my
duplicate's photo please.

840
00:49:33,666 --> 00:49:35,540
I don't like hitting
myself with darts!

841
00:49:35,625 --> 00:49:37,707
We have to hit him first!
M^%**$@!

842
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:38,791
Chuck it, Uncle!

843
00:49:38,833 --> 00:49:40,624
Why should he chuck it!

844
00:49:41,041 --> 00:49:43,082
Our vengeance should
be full & absolute.

845
00:49:43,708 --> 00:49:47,707
Charlie, this plan to
rob the diamonds I understand,

846
00:49:48,333 --> 00:49:51,874
but I don't get this fire
of vengeance that's burning in him..

847
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:53,915
There's some story to all this...

848
00:49:54,458 --> 00:49:55,458
isn't it?

849
00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:04,865
This story is about diamonds...

850
00:50:06,541 --> 00:50:08,290
It was all about...

851
00:50:09,416 --> 00:50:10,832
a handful of diamonds.

852
00:50:11,708 --> 00:50:14,749
Charlie's father Manohar
& me used to work together!

853
00:50:15,333 --> 00:50:17,332
Not colleagues, we were friends.

854
00:50:17,791 --> 00:50:20,290
And not friends like you
who poke each other on Facebook..

855
00:50:20,375 --> 00:50:21,874
From Friday to Friday...

856
00:50:22,208 --> 00:50:23,415
real friends!

857
00:50:24,291 --> 00:50:25,707
Friends?

858
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,624
We were like family!

859
00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:31,165
When I left the army,

860
00:50:31,375 --> 00:50:33,874
Manohar uncle included me
in his family as well!

861
00:50:35,291 --> 00:50:37,457
Both of us used to test his systems.

862
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:38,999
Dad had the contracts...

863
00:50:39,250 --> 00:50:41,707
for the security
of the entire Diamond Market...

864
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:45,332
And all was very good..

865
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:50,207
Then Charan Grover
came into our lives.

866
00:50:53,416 --> 00:50:56,374
Charan Grover was a
dealer of African diamonds.

867
00:50:56,708 --> 00:50:59,874
He gave dad the contract to make
the most advanced safe in the world.

868
00:51:00,333 --> 00:51:01,749
Dad decided to call it.

869
00:51:01,916 --> 00:51:02,916
Shalimar!

870
00:51:03,416 --> 00:51:06,582
For dad & these two guys,
it was their biggest project ever.

871
00:51:06,916 --> 00:51:08,999
They took loans from the market...

872
00:51:09,208 --> 00:51:11,249
and after one year
of intense hard work..

873
00:51:11,458 --> 00:51:13,707
Finally Shalimar was ready.

874
00:51:14,958 --> 00:51:16,838
Charan Grover's first
consignment of diamonds...

875
00:51:17,041 --> 00:51:18,374
was worth 20 million dollars.

876
00:51:18,708 --> 00:51:19,790
20 million?

877
00:51:20,916 --> 00:51:22,499
I still remember...

878
00:51:23,333 --> 00:51:25,213
the night the diamonds
were kept in the safe,

879
00:51:25,333 --> 00:51:26,665
It was New Year's eve!

880
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:27,790
Mr. Grover!

881
00:51:28,333 --> 00:51:33,499
I'll request you to please change
the combination of the safe and...

882
00:51:36,625 --> 00:51:38,374
put in your own fingerprints too.

883
00:51:39,333 --> 00:51:40,540
Manohar!

884
00:51:40,791 --> 00:51:41,999
What's the hurry?

885
00:51:42,625 --> 00:51:45,457
It's new years eve, enjoy yourself.

886
00:51:46,125 --> 00:51:46,957
Have a drink!

887
00:51:47,041 --> 00:51:48,041
Come on!

888
00:51:48,125 --> 00:51:51,582
Mr. Grover, I can't take
such a big responsibility.

889
00:51:52,208 --> 00:51:55,582
Right now, there are 20 million worth
of diamonds in the Shalimar and..

890
00:51:55,666 --> 00:51:57,290
And no one can open it except you...

891
00:51:57,875 --> 00:51:58,915
I know that.

892
00:51:59,291 --> 00:52:00,874
But you are not a thief..

893
00:52:01,625 --> 00:52:02,499
Hmm?

894
00:52:02,625 --> 00:52:05,540
Come on today is new year.
Come on. Come on.

895
00:52:05,625 --> 00:52:07,957
Come on, happy new year, cheers.

896
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:09,832
Enjoy!

897
00:52:12,875 --> 00:52:16,207
That night Grover
showed his true colors.

898
00:52:17,166 --> 00:52:18,707
He drugged my Dad.

899
00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:21,957
Dad was seeing himself
get ruined with his own eyes,

900
00:52:22,041 --> 00:52:23,874
and couldn't even
lift a finger to stop it.

901
00:52:24,166 --> 00:52:26,290
Grover stole his own diamonds..

902
00:52:26,375 --> 00:52:27,665
And then called the police.

903
00:52:27,875 --> 00:52:30,790
The cops found dad's fingerprints
on the biometric lock.

904
00:52:30,875 --> 00:52:32,790
Grover took the diamonds..

905
00:52:32,875 --> 00:52:35,415
And then he got the
insurance claim too.

906
00:52:36,041 --> 00:52:38,957
Dad was boycotted by
the entire Diamond Market.

907
00:52:39,833 --> 00:52:41,749
And he got arrested.

908
00:52:43,625 --> 00:52:45,624
Dad was jailed for 12 years.

909
00:52:47,291 --> 00:52:48,790
Rigorous imprisonment.

910
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:52,082
He wasn't allowed
to meet anyone...

911
00:52:54,458 --> 00:52:57,165
Jag & Tammy also had to leave
the city in-case the cops got to them.

912
00:53:00,125 --> 00:53:02,290
I was left to fend for myself...

913
00:53:05,125 --> 00:53:07,915
And Charan Grover, who ruined us all -

914
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,165
went to Dubai and solely took over
Shalimar International and today..

915
00:53:13,333 --> 00:53:15,773
Is living a life of immense
luxuries and colossal comforts.

916
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:19,249
He's got fate on his side!

917
00:53:20,958 --> 00:53:23,249
Fate is a fickle mistress, Nandu!

918
00:53:24,291 --> 00:53:26,457
It can turn tables anytime!

919
00:53:28,666 --> 00:53:31,457
This time I'm going to
send Charan Grover to Jail..

920
00:53:33,333 --> 00:53:34,790
For a very long time.

921
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:36,665
Hear. Hear!

922
00:53:37,166 --> 00:53:38,249
He'll go.

923
00:53:39,208 --> 00:53:41,415
He'll surely go, Charlie.

924
00:53:45,916 --> 00:53:47,249
Why didn't you tell me before..

925
00:53:47,708 --> 00:53:49,249
That this is all about your dad?

926
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:52,290
I'm here for my mom..

927
00:53:52,791 --> 00:53:54,165
And you're here for your dad!

928
00:53:55,333 --> 00:53:58,415
We are both bound by our grief.

929
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,207
Thank you.

930
00:54:00,666 --> 00:54:01,874
Brother...

931
00:54:02,291 --> 00:54:03,582
I kiss you!

932
00:54:04,125 --> 00:54:05,125
Kiss...

933
00:54:05,208 --> 00:54:06,332
- What kiss?
- Kiss please.

934
00:54:06,416 --> 00:54:07,540
No, no, you can't kiss me, Nandu!

935
00:54:07,625 --> 00:54:09,207
No, no, you can't kiss me.
One kiss, please!

936
00:54:09,291 --> 00:54:10,207
What is he saying, guys?
Charlie..

937
00:54:10,291 --> 00:54:11,332
No please!

938
00:54:11,750 --> 00:54:12,499
Charlie..

939
00:54:12,583 --> 00:54:14,082
I swear on my mother...

940
00:54:14,625 --> 00:54:17,332
you guys are a heartless bunch.

941
00:54:17,416 --> 00:54:19,656
You take me into your flashbacks
and make me sentimental,

942
00:54:19,708 --> 00:54:22,290
and after that, Charlie,
you won't let me give you one kiss?

943
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:23,749
Hey just cut it out!

944
00:54:23,833 --> 00:54:25,374
Here we are so tense
about the dance competition...

945
00:54:25,458 --> 00:54:26,624
and all you are worried
about is a damn kiss!

946
00:54:26,708 --> 00:54:28,332
Of course, you'll be tense!

947
00:54:28,541 --> 00:54:29,749
You know why?

948
00:54:30,083 --> 00:54:32,290
Because you guys are
learning it all wrong!

949
00:54:32,625 --> 00:54:33,540
Charlie...

950
00:54:33,625 --> 00:54:34,999
does anyone learn
how to dance like this?

951
00:54:35,208 --> 00:54:38,082
1,2,3,4..

952
00:54:38,166 --> 00:54:39,374
Damn you!

953
00:54:40,666 --> 00:54:43,249
Dance is automajic.

954
00:54:43,333 --> 00:54:44,582
Automajic!

955
00:54:45,166 --> 00:54:46,374
I will get...

956
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:49,332
a dance teacher for you guys,
Charlie, come let's go.

957
00:54:49,416 --> 00:54:50,832
Aahaan..Don't touch me.

958
00:54:51,666 --> 00:54:52,749
Where do we have to go?

959
00:54:52,958 --> 00:54:54,915
Where...

960
00:54:55,541 --> 00:54:57,707
there is golden
liquor in our throats..

961
00:54:57,958 --> 00:55:00,874
Sparkling Radiance in our
hearts and in front of us we have..

962
00:55:00,958 --> 00:55:07,915
Mohini..

963
00:55:29,833 --> 00:55:37,833
"Hearing your name,
my heart beats."

964
00:55:45,333 --> 00:55:47,624
"Oh beloved, Oh love."

965
00:55:47,708 --> 00:55:49,665
"Oh life, Oh luck."

966
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:52,124
"Oh beloved, Oh love."

967
00:55:55,375 --> 00:55:57,249
"I am more beautiful now"

968
00:55:57,333 --> 00:55:59,832
"By saying your name."

969
00:55:59,916 --> 00:56:01,499
"I am more beautiful now"

970
00:56:01,583 --> 00:56:02,665
"By saying your name."

971
00:56:02,750 --> 00:56:03,750
"Your name."

972
00:56:04,666 --> 00:56:06,415
"I am more beautiful now"

973
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:08,874
"By saying your name."

974
00:56:08,958 --> 00:56:10,665
"I am more beautiful now"

975
00:56:10,750 --> 00:56:11,750
"By saying your name."

976
00:56:11,791 --> 00:56:12,791
"Your name."

977
00:56:13,541 --> 00:56:21,541
"My beloved has returned to me"

978
00:56:30,333 --> 00:56:32,790
"These red bangles of mine"

979
00:56:32,875 --> 00:56:34,915
"Ring out for you"

980
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:38,249
"They dance for you,
sing out for you."

981
00:56:38,958 --> 00:56:40,999
"Such an intoxication."

982
00:56:41,083 --> 00:56:43,124
"In your anticipation."

983
00:56:43,291 --> 00:56:45,332
"One touch is all it took"

984
00:56:45,416 --> 00:56:47,249
"I'm yours forever now."

985
00:56:47,333 --> 00:56:49,249
"I am more beautiful now"

986
00:56:49,333 --> 00:56:51,749
"By saying your name"

987
00:56:51,833 --> 00:56:53,540
"I am more beautiful now"

988
00:56:53,625 --> 00:56:54,625
"By saying your name"

989
00:56:54,708 --> 00:56:55,749
"Your name"

990
00:56:56,083 --> 00:56:57,874
"I am more beautiful now"

991
00:56:57,958 --> 00:57:00,332
"By saying your name"

992
00:57:00,416 --> 00:57:02,082
"I am more beautiful now"

993
00:57:02,166 --> 00:57:03,166
"By saying your name"

994
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:04,374
"Your name"

995
00:57:04,916 --> 00:57:06,415
"I am more beautiful now"

996
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:08,624
"By saying your name"

997
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,624
"I am more beautiful now"

998
00:57:10,708 --> 00:57:11,708
"By saying your name"

999
00:57:11,791 --> 00:57:12,874
"Your name"

1000
00:57:13,166 --> 00:57:15,749
"She's put kohl in her eyes."

1001
00:57:15,833 --> 00:57:17,874
"Looking at me she's gone mad."

1002
00:57:17,958 --> 00:57:19,874
"Having taken photo and autograph."

1003
00:57:19,958 --> 00:57:22,040
"She keeps liking
the pics on instagram."

1004
00:57:22,125 --> 00:57:24,124
"Oh girl, what you are doing?"

1005
00:57:24,208 --> 00:57:26,290
"Please leave my friends alone."

1006
00:57:26,375 --> 00:57:28,749
"Listen girl you have gone mad."

1007
00:57:28,833 --> 00:57:30,749
"Says there's no one else like her."

1008
00:57:30,833 --> 00:57:32,124
"I am more beautiful now"

1009
00:57:32,208 --> 00:57:34,499
"By saying your name"

1010
00:57:34,583 --> 00:57:36,457
"I am more beautiful now"

1011
00:57:36,541 --> 00:57:37,415
"By saying your name"

1012
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:38,707
"Your name"

1013
00:57:47,291 --> 00:57:48,790
"There is complete arrangement."

1014
00:57:48,875 --> 00:57:49,874
"This evening you're the only one"

1015
00:57:49,958 --> 00:57:51,999
"I'm yours until the morning comes"

1016
00:57:52,083 --> 00:57:55,415
"Listen to the song in my heart"

1017
00:57:56,083 --> 00:57:58,165
"who knows about tomorrow?"

1018
00:57:58,250 --> 00:58:00,374
"Tell me your joys and sorrows"

1019
00:58:00,625 --> 00:58:04,124
"I know it's kind of crazy
but I am yours forever now."

1020
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:06,415
"I am more beautiful now"

1021
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:08,874
"By saying your name"

1022
00:58:08,958 --> 00:58:10,707
"I am more beautiful now"

1023
00:58:10,791 --> 00:58:11,791
"By saying your name"

1024
00:58:11,833 --> 00:58:12,874
"Your name"

1025
00:58:13,208 --> 00:58:14,957
"I am more beautiful now"

1026
00:58:15,041 --> 00:58:17,457
"By saying your name"

1027
00:58:17,541 --> 00:58:19,207
"I am more beautiful now"

1028
00:58:19,291 --> 00:58:20,291
"By saying your name"

1029
00:58:20,375 --> 00:58:21,375
"Your name"

1030
00:58:34,041 --> 00:58:35,749
"I am more beautiful now"

1031
00:58:35,833 --> 00:58:38,040
"By saying your name"

1032
00:58:38,125 --> 00:58:39,832
"I am more beautiful now"

1033
00:58:39,916 --> 00:58:40,916
"By saying your name"

1034
00:58:40,958 --> 00:58:41,958
"Your name"

1035
00:58:42,250 --> 00:58:43,874
"I am more beautiful now"

1036
00:58:43,958 --> 00:58:46,249
"By saying your name"

1037
00:58:46,333 --> 00:58:48,082
"I am more beautiful now"

1038
00:58:48,166 --> 00:58:49,040
"By saying your name"

1039
00:58:49,125 --> 00:58:50,290
"Your name"

1040
00:58:59,541 --> 00:59:01,874
Tell me, Mohini,
will you come teach us how to dance?

1041
00:59:01,958 --> 00:59:02,958
Hey..

1042
00:59:03,291 --> 00:59:05,415
You think it's easy
to dance like Mohini?

1043
00:59:05,458 --> 00:59:06,749
It's not easy!

1044
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:09,999
There are just 2 people
in the world who can do it...

1045
00:59:10,208 --> 00:59:12,207
One is JLO, the other is Shakira!

1046
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:15,249
There is no dancer like
Mohini in the whole of India.

1047
00:59:15,333 --> 00:59:17,957
You are not going to get
such a chance in your whole life!

1048
00:59:18,125 --> 00:59:19,582
You will be on TV, girl, on TV!

1049
00:59:19,666 --> 00:59:20,957
With you guys?

1050
00:59:21,125 --> 00:59:23,165
Will make a fool
out of myself for sure!

1051
00:59:23,583 --> 00:59:25,707
That will be the
End of my dance school.

1052
00:59:26,083 --> 00:59:27,083
School?

1053
00:59:27,541 --> 00:59:28,832
Hey Dimwit!

1054
00:59:29,208 --> 00:59:31,457
Mohini doesn't dance here for joy!

1055
00:59:31,541 --> 00:59:33,874
I want to earn some money
And open my own school.

1056
00:59:34,166 --> 00:59:37,415
I want to teach small,
Tiny kids how to dance.

1057
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:39,415
What will you get out of that?

1058
00:59:40,208 --> 00:59:41,374
Respect.

1059
00:59:41,833 --> 00:59:43,915
Something that no girl here gets.

1060
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,582
You know, my mom used to say...

1061
00:59:45,666 --> 00:59:48,624
the most important
thing in life is respect.

1062
00:59:49,708 --> 00:59:51,207
I will teach you guys how to dance?

1063
00:59:51,416 --> 00:59:53,665
Dance is worship...

1064
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,915
dance is an art! Art!

1065
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,540
Where did I say it's a fart!

1066
00:59:59,250 --> 01:00:00,082
Out.. Out!

1067
01:00:00,250 --> 01:00:01,290
Get out of here.

1068
01:00:01,375 --> 01:00:02,707
Troubling me since childhood.

1069
01:00:02,875 --> 01:00:04,915
Hey, Mohini!
Don't get upset common..

1070
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,874
Relax, Nandu! Don't force her.

1071
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,207
There's no compulsion.

1072
01:00:09,166 --> 01:00:09,957
Mohini.

1073
01:00:10,041 --> 01:00:12,457
We really appreciate
You taking out time for us...

1074
01:00:12,541 --> 01:00:13,874
He speaks in English!

1075
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,665
"I've got a feeling!"

1076
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:24,624
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious...

1077
01:00:24,708 --> 01:00:28,207
I forgot to mention the 2 things which
Are essential to know about Mohini.

1078
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:31,040
Mohini loves the English.

1079
01:00:31,250 --> 01:00:34,457
And Mohini can't speak the English.

1080
01:00:35,166 --> 01:00:36,374
Excuse me.

1081
01:00:37,291 --> 01:00:38,291
Yes, Jag?

1082
01:00:38,333 --> 01:00:39,540
He speaks in English?

1083
01:00:39,625 --> 01:00:40,540
Yes, Yes!

1084
01:00:40,625 --> 01:00:41,625
Full English...

1085
01:00:41,666 --> 01:00:42,374
Charlie!

1086
01:00:42,458 --> 01:00:43,790
He's my friend!

1087
01:00:44,333 --> 01:00:45,457
I have to teach him too?

1088
01:00:45,541 --> 01:00:47,124
You have to teach him the most!

1089
01:00:47,208 --> 01:00:49,165
He is the captain of our team!

1090
01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:53,832
Text me the address...

1091
01:00:53,916 --> 01:00:54,999
I will be there tomorrow at 9.

1092
01:00:55,083 --> 01:00:56,707
Hey, Mohini!

1093
01:00:57,708 --> 01:00:59,582
Charlie, she's agreed!

1094
01:01:00,541 --> 01:01:01,624
Charlie!

1095
01:01:02,291 --> 01:01:03,665
His name's 'English' too!

1096
01:01:11,333 --> 01:01:13,957
The question is not about who she is,
what she is...

1097
01:01:14,041 --> 01:01:15,499
or what she does?

1098
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,040
What matters, is what she is for us?

1099
01:01:19,791 --> 01:01:22,124
And for us, she is just a teacher.

1100
01:01:22,708 --> 01:01:23,582
Hmm?

1101
01:01:23,666 --> 01:01:26,999
Who will make us rehearse
from 9 in the morning...

1102
01:01:27,333 --> 01:01:29,415
to 6 in the evening, that's it.

1103
01:01:29,708 --> 01:01:31,832
From 9 am to 6 pm...

1104
01:01:32,083 --> 01:01:34,874
we will forget
what she actually is.

1105
01:01:34,958 --> 01:01:36,957
Yes, yes, yes, Jag I know what she is.

1106
01:01:37,041 --> 01:01:38,961
She's a bar dancer who
wears these teensy weensy,

1107
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,624
short, sexy clothes...

1108
01:01:40,833 --> 01:01:44,332
and dances in front of
random men for money.

1109
01:01:44,416 --> 01:01:46,082
But what really matters, Tammy?

1110
01:01:46,458 --> 01:01:48,218
We have nothing to
do with her personal life.

1111
01:01:48,291 --> 01:01:50,082
What difference does it make to us?

1112
01:01:50,666 --> 01:01:52,582
She is our teacher...

1113
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,332
And it's important
that we respect her.

1114
01:01:54,416 --> 01:01:58,040
And you specially Nandu, you too
are cheap like her aren't you. Yeah?

1115
01:01:58,125 --> 01:01:59,457
And it's alright.

1116
01:02:00,791 --> 01:02:02,124
She's a call girl...

1117
01:02:02,291 --> 01:02:05,290
she's cheap,
she's vulgar, she's tacky...

1118
01:02:05,375 --> 01:02:07,249
But now she is what she is.

1119
01:02:08,250 --> 01:02:10,207
You understand Rohan,
What I'm trying to say?

1120
01:02:10,375 --> 01:02:11,082
Hmm?

1121
01:02:11,166 --> 01:02:14,040
What I'm trying to say Charlie,
is that she is standing behind you.

1122
01:02:14,541 --> 01:02:15,624
No!

1123
01:02:16,333 --> 01:02:17,790
- Yes!
- No.

1124
01:02:20,125 --> 01:02:21,249
Charlie!

1125
01:02:35,916 --> 01:02:37,332
- Mohini!
- Enough!

1126
01:02:38,875 --> 01:02:40,082
Mohini has been dancing in front of...

1127
01:02:40,166 --> 01:02:41,665
drunk strangers since two years,

1128
01:02:42,916 --> 01:02:46,332
but no one has ever
made me feel so cheap.

1129
01:02:49,125 --> 01:02:50,499
Thanks.

1130
01:02:51,875 --> 01:02:52,875
Mohini!

1131
01:02:56,541 --> 01:02:57,874
Charlie...

1132
01:02:58,333 --> 01:03:00,040
apologize in English!

1133
01:03:00,958 --> 01:03:02,874
Hey, Mohini, listen up..

1134
01:03:03,208 --> 01:03:05,582
Hey, stop please Mohini
Please, please, stop..

1135
01:03:05,666 --> 01:03:06,749
Stop, please!

1136
01:03:06,958 --> 01:03:07,958
I..

1137
01:03:08,291 --> 01:03:09,624
I apologize!

1138
01:03:09,708 --> 01:03:12,040
I'm really, really very sorry.

1139
01:03:12,708 --> 01:03:13,832
Actually the thing is..

1140
01:03:13,916 --> 01:03:15,476
You are the only
lady in this group..

1141
01:03:15,541 --> 01:03:17,040
- Girl, not lady.
- Exactly!

1142
01:03:17,291 --> 01:03:18,291
A call girl.

1143
01:03:18,375 --> 01:03:21,124
No, you heard this out of context.

1144
01:03:21,583 --> 01:03:23,624
What I was trying to do is
get these idiots to respect you.

1145
01:03:23,708 --> 01:03:26,082
How on earth will they
respect me if you don't.

1146
01:03:26,166 --> 01:03:27,166
Who told you that?

1147
01:03:27,208 --> 01:03:28,040
I do, I do immensely..

1148
01:03:28,125 --> 01:03:31,749
I respect you.
I really respect you a lot.

1149
01:03:31,833 --> 01:03:32,665
- Really?
- Yes!

1150
01:03:32,750 --> 01:03:33,457
- Why?
- Why?

1151
01:03:33,541 --> 01:03:34,790
Why respect Mohini?

1152
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:38,040
'Cause Mohini, you
are such an exceptional dancer!

1153
01:03:38,375 --> 01:03:40,082
Perhaps the best in the world.

1154
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:43,582
Last night when I saw you
for the first time I was mesmerized,

1155
01:03:43,666 --> 01:03:46,957
hypnotized, the passion,
the expression, the rhythm.

1156
01:03:47,250 --> 01:03:50,957
The movement of your booty,
the beauty of your movements.

1157
01:03:51,333 --> 01:03:53,415
And your big thighs... eyes...

1158
01:03:53,875 --> 01:03:56,415
And your hips don't lie.

1159
01:03:57,208 --> 01:03:58,332
Mohini...

1160
01:03:58,750 --> 01:04:01,624
you are simply
b****t taking, breath taking.

1161
01:04:05,166 --> 01:04:08,457
Actually Mohini we are
all losers, me too.

1162
01:04:09,333 --> 01:04:11,665
And we want to win this competition
and that can't happen without you,

1163
01:04:11,750 --> 01:04:13,540
It's not possible without you.

1164
01:04:13,791 --> 01:04:15,457
I'm ready to do whatever you say.

1165
01:04:15,541 --> 01:04:18,332
Anything..
Anything just please don't say no.

1166
01:04:19,458 --> 01:04:20,458
Nau.. (Nine)

1167
01:04:22,375 --> 01:04:23,375
No!

1168
01:04:25,041 --> 01:04:26,082
Nau.. (Nine)

1169
01:04:27,791 --> 01:04:28,832
No!

1170
01:04:31,291 --> 01:04:32,624
Nine! Its nine o'clock...

1171
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,207
It's time for rehearsals.

1172
01:04:35,416 --> 01:04:37,707
Mohini hate lateness...

1173
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,124
lateness?

1174
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:41,457
I promise you Mohini..

1175
01:04:41,833 --> 01:04:43,582
I will never be late in my life!

1176
01:04:43,750 --> 01:04:44,832
Never.

1177
01:05:18,291 --> 01:05:23,082
"I've got a feeling.."

1178
01:05:23,166 --> 01:05:28,332
"A feeling in my heart"

1179
01:05:28,416 --> 01:05:29,499
"That you are..."

1180
01:05:29,583 --> 01:05:31,749
"The one in my soul,
in my life, in my dreams.."

1181
01:05:31,833 --> 01:05:33,082
"..from the start"

1182
01:05:33,166 --> 01:05:35,249
"I've got a feeling!"

1183
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,874
"I've got a feeling"

1184
01:05:37,958 --> 01:05:43,249
"A feeling in my heart"

1185
01:05:43,333 --> 01:05:47,999
"I'll give you my soul,
and my life and we'll never be apart."

1186
01:05:48,083 --> 01:05:50,749
"I'm just a traveler from afar"

1187
01:05:50,833 --> 01:05:53,665
"I am the light from a shining star"

1188
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:58,749
"I can't be held in your soul,
in your life"

1189
01:05:58,833 --> 01:06:01,124
"Or the depths of your heart."

1190
01:06:02,791 --> 01:06:07,374
"I've got a feeling.."

1191
01:06:07,458 --> 01:06:12,915
"A feeling in my heart"

1192
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,000
"That you are"

1193
01:06:14,041 --> 01:06:16,124
"The one in my soul,
in my life, in my dreams.."

1194
01:06:16,208 --> 01:06:17,415
"..from the start!"

1195
01:06:42,458 --> 01:06:45,290
"They speak to me,
those eyes of yours"

1196
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:49,915
"Now, I belong to only you,
and of course"

1197
01:06:50,250 --> 01:06:52,832
"You're mine, too."

1198
01:06:54,291 --> 01:06:57,165
"Don't tie me up with
your delicate words"

1199
01:06:57,250 --> 01:06:59,874
"Don't color my life
with love because,"

1200
01:06:59,958 --> 01:07:04,999
"I can't be yours."

1201
01:07:05,083 --> 01:07:09,040
"Someday you will love somebody"

1202
01:07:09,125 --> 01:07:12,207
"That somebody could well be me!"

1203
01:07:12,291 --> 01:07:19,249
"You are living a
dream in your heart."

1204
01:07:19,833 --> 01:07:21,582
"On the walls of."

1205
01:07:22,583 --> 01:07:24,415
"The very walls of."

1206
01:07:24,666 --> 01:07:29,957
"The walls of my beating heart."

1207
01:07:30,041 --> 01:07:33,082
"Are pictures of you, of your love
Of your soul, only you"

1208
01:07:33,166 --> 01:07:35,957
"From the start!"

1209
01:07:40,833 --> 01:07:43,790
"My lover plays a game.."

1210
01:07:43,875 --> 01:07:46,790
"My heartbeat sings his name."

1211
01:07:46,875 --> 01:07:49,707
"His eyes meet mine."

1212
01:07:49,791 --> 01:07:54,540
"And our love burns like a flame."

1213
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:09,624
"Your eyes have cast a magical spell."

1214
01:08:09,833 --> 01:08:12,457
"Come into my arms just once,
and well."

1215
01:08:12,541 --> 01:08:17,665
"I have become yours!"

1216
01:08:18,041 --> 01:08:21,499
"The air begins to simmer."

1217
01:08:21,583 --> 01:08:24,499
"And of love, we catch a glimmer."

1218
01:08:24,833 --> 01:08:26,957
"We float, we fly,"

1219
01:08:27,041 --> 01:08:31,999
"Into the sky, amongst the stars."

1220
01:08:32,416 --> 01:08:37,290
"I've got a feeling.."

1221
01:08:37,375 --> 01:08:42,582
"A feeling in my heart"

1222
01:08:42,666 --> 01:08:43,582
"That you are"

1223
01:08:43,666 --> 01:08:45,707
"The one in my soul,
in my life, in my dreams,"

1224
01:08:45,791 --> 01:08:48,124
"from the start."

1225
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:55,082
"You are the one in my life,
in my soul, in my dreams"

1226
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:56,790
"That you are"

1227
01:08:56,875 --> 01:08:59,124
"The one in my soul,
in my life, in my dreams,"

1228
01:08:59,208 --> 01:09:00,957
"from the start."

1229
01:09:01,875 --> 01:09:02,875
"That you are"

1230
01:09:02,958 --> 01:09:04,957
"The one in my soul,
in my life, in my dreams,"

1231
01:09:05,041 --> 01:09:07,332
"from the start"

1232
01:09:07,791 --> 01:09:14,499
"You are the one in my life,
in my soul, in my dreams."

1233
01:09:22,958 --> 01:09:25,374
Welcome to PNB Metlife presents,

1234
01:09:25,541 --> 01:09:26,832
India auditions-

1235
01:09:26,916 --> 01:09:29,082
WDC!

1236
01:09:29,916 --> 01:09:32,915
As you can see, the top dancing
teams of India are present here...

1237
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,832
But the judges will choose
only 5 teams.

1238
01:09:35,916 --> 01:09:37,415
Who will be these teams?

1239
01:09:41,083 --> 01:09:42,874
"These are the Indiawale."

1240
01:09:46,875 --> 01:09:47,875
Move..

1241
01:09:50,583 --> 01:09:52,332
"Indiawale."

1242
01:09:55,041 --> 01:09:56,957
An epic war is in
progress behind this door!

1243
01:09:57,041 --> 01:09:59,749
One by one, like injured soldiers,
people are coming out.

1244
01:09:59,833 --> 01:10:01,374
This was a damn good team!

1245
01:10:01,458 --> 01:10:02,999
They rejected them too?

1246
01:10:03,083 --> 01:10:04,540
These two judges are big jerks!

1247
01:10:04,625 --> 01:10:06,415
Our selection is impossible!

1248
01:10:06,708 --> 01:10:08,999
And look at him! Our captain!

1249
01:10:09,083 --> 01:10:11,999
He's the worst dancer
amongst us and he's laughing!

1250
01:10:12,083 --> 01:10:13,540
- Shameless!
- Team Diamonds!

1251
01:10:13,625 --> 01:10:14,665
Here!

1252
01:10:14,750 --> 01:10:17,957
And the next team that's
going in is Team Diamonds,

1253
01:10:18,041 --> 01:10:20,540
The judges haven't selected
a single team till now,

1254
01:10:20,625 --> 01:10:22,957
let's see what happens
with these folks. Good luck,

1255
01:10:23,041 --> 01:10:24,290
All the best..

1256
01:10:24,708 --> 01:10:26,040
To the judges.

1257
01:10:32,083 --> 01:10:33,457
Yes.

1258
01:10:34,375 --> 01:10:36,832
What the hell was that?

1259
01:10:36,916 --> 01:10:38,707
What vulgar positions are these?

1260
01:10:38,750 --> 01:10:41,332
How dare you show
us such a vulgar dance?

1261
01:10:41,666 --> 01:10:44,290
Vishal sir, Anurag sir,
why are you guys getting angry?

1262
01:10:44,416 --> 01:10:46,665
This is completely inspired by you.

1263
01:10:46,750 --> 01:10:49,999
Actually by the two of you..

1264
01:10:50,916 --> 01:10:52,999
We saw a video...

1265
01:10:53,083 --> 01:10:55,749
And the two of you have taken such
incredible positions in that video.

1266
01:10:55,833 --> 01:10:57,374
We were flabbergasted!

1267
01:10:57,458 --> 01:10:58,499
Rohan?

1268
01:10:58,833 --> 01:11:01,082
Why don't you see
the video for yourself..

1269
01:11:07,541 --> 01:11:09,832
See it and be double sure.

1270
01:11:13,708 --> 01:11:16,415
Anurag sir, pink is so your color...

1271
01:11:16,708 --> 01:11:19,540
and Vishal sir, your hairy back.

1272
01:11:19,833 --> 01:11:22,707
Have your wives seen this video?

1273
01:11:23,750 --> 01:11:26,665
We were thinking of
putting it up on Youtube.

1274
01:11:27,375 --> 01:11:28,040
Huh?

1275
01:11:28,125 --> 01:11:29,125
No?

1276
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,082
So tell me..

You guys have 7 Minutes.

01:13:02,541 --> 01:13:06,332
Who knows if we will be
together after today, or not.

1308
01:13:07,416 --> 01:13:10,415
Will we ever get an opportunity
like this again, or not.

1309
01:13:10,708 --> 01:13:11,915
But today!

1310

these 7 minutes away from you.

See the damn score!

And what do we have here?

1420
01:18:28,791 --> 01:18:30,415
Team Diamonds points are increasing!

1421
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:31,582
People are actually voting for them!

1422
01:18:31,666 --> 01:18:32,957
I don't believe what's happening...

1423

01:18:38,541 --> 01:18:40,082
Number 3 position..

1426
01:18:40,166 --> 01:18:41,957
I do not believe this...

1427
01:18:42,041 --> 01:18:45,582
Team Diamonds are
now at the second position!

1428
01:18:45,666 --> 01:18:47,832
God! This is going to
be a really close fight...

1429
01:18:47,916 --> 01:18:50,832
and the difference
in votes is diminishing..

1430
01:18:50,916 --> 01:18:54,499
And now as per my watch

1431
01:18:54,583 --> 01:18:56,790

1455
01:19:45,875 --> 01:19:47,415
Charlie! We did it!

1456
01:19:47,750 --> 01:19:50,040
Charlie I can't
Believe that we've won!

1457
01:19:50,541 --> 01:19:52,415
- They are calling us!
- Come on!

1458
01:20:07,125 --> 01:20:09,707
In this world,
there are two kinds of people...

1459
01:20:10,416 --> 01:20:11,457
Winners...

1460
01:20:11,541 --> 01:20:12,665
and Losers.

1461
01:20:13,458 --> 01:20:14,874
But life...

1462
01:20:15,208 --> 01:20:16,874
gives a second
chance to every loser...

1463
01:20:18,333 --> 01:20:21,957
with which he can redeem himself.

1464
01:20:23,166 --> 01:20:25,124
And this is just half the battle won..

1465
01:20:25,875 --> 01:20:28,915
The show's just begun...

1466
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:30,290
my friend!

1467
01:21:16,833 --> 01:21:19,249
I am beauty on duty Lola Kutty...

1468
01:21:19,333 --> 01:21:22,415
reporting live from
the Atlantis Hotel in Dubai!

1469
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:24,749
Behind me is the
Hungarian team...

1470
01:21:24,875 --> 01:21:26,249
It's like a hot dream.

1471
01:21:26,333 --> 01:21:28,415
Oh this year we want to win!

1472
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:29,707
Well to do that you're
gonna have to...

1473
01:21:29,791 --> 01:21:31,957
get past North Korea
last year's champions...

1474
01:21:32,083 --> 01:21:33,874
oh speaking of which here they are-

1475
01:21:33,958 --> 01:21:35,082
Team Korea!!

1476
01:21:39,666 --> 01:21:41,040
Team Korea!

1477
01:21:41,125 --> 01:21:43,415
No soul, very danger!

1478
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:45,249
Dancing like robots only!

1479
01:21:45,333 --> 01:21:46,457
Everyone come down...

1480
01:21:50,666 --> 01:21:51,666
Let's go!

1481
01:21:55,791 --> 01:21:56,540
Yes...

1482
01:21:56,625 --> 01:21:58,957
Mr. Huyi Chuk? Mr. Huyi Chuk?

1483
01:21:59,208 --> 01:22:02,249
Perfectly bad manners!

1484
01:22:06,375 --> 01:22:11,624
Be the Indiawale.

1485
01:22:11,708 --> 01:22:13,915
Oh my goodness, looks like Team India
has just arrived.

1486
01:22:18,041 --> 01:22:19,707
Be the Indiawale

1487
01:22:27,541 --> 01:22:29,624
Go back home.

1488
01:22:30,875 --> 01:22:32,957
Go back.

1489
01:22:33,291 --> 01:22:34,749
Oh my God they are throwing things!

1490
01:22:34,875 --> 01:22:36,275
I have never seen anything like it.

1491
01:22:36,291 --> 01:22:39,165
People of a country stopping their
own team from participating!

1492
01:22:39,625 --> 01:22:41,957
It tastes sweet.

1493
01:22:43,166 --> 01:22:43,915
Hey!

1494
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,290
Damn You!

1495
01:22:46,666 --> 01:22:48,624
Team India! Welcome to Dubai!

1496
01:22:48,791 --> 01:22:50,540
Actually, not welcome at all!

1497
01:22:50,625 --> 01:22:52,999
Why you are here
to shame us like this?

1498
01:22:53,250 --> 01:22:55,290
You talk to me with some respect!

1499
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:58,540
Aye why we go? You home go!
We are here to dance!

1500
01:22:58,625 --> 01:23:00,332
Can't you see I am a dancer?

1501
01:23:00,958 --> 01:23:03,749
Hey... Why are you hiding you coward?

1502
01:23:03,958 --> 01:23:05,707
Throw now if you can.

1503
01:23:05,791 --> 01:23:08,332
Reply them.

1504
01:23:08,750 --> 01:23:10,457
Everybody settle down!

1505
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:11,207
Please. Enough!

1506
01:23:11,291 --> 01:23:12,582
Enough! Enough! Enough!

1507
01:23:12,666 --> 01:23:14,165
You guys, too. Quiet please.

1508
01:23:14,791 --> 01:23:16,457
Wow! What a fantastic entry!

1509
01:23:16,541 --> 01:23:17,749
Tammy?

1510
01:23:17,916 --> 01:23:20,332
Nandu, Jag, go and pick up your bags!

1511
01:23:20,458 --> 01:23:21,249
All of you.

1512
01:23:21,333 --> 01:23:22,333
You as well.

1513
01:23:24,041 --> 01:23:25,457
Please, go.

1514
01:23:31,583 --> 01:23:33,223
Charlie, I was trying
to stop the fight...

1515
01:23:33,291 --> 01:23:35,165
You are a complete embarrassment!

1516
01:23:35,416 --> 01:23:36,457
- Means?
- Huh!

1517
01:23:37,083 --> 01:23:38,124
Tch!

1518
01:23:40,500 --> 01:23:42,415
Are you a complete idiot?

1519
01:24:01,041 --> 01:24:02,624
Oh India desk?

1520
01:24:02,708 --> 01:24:04,124
Hello darling!

1521
01:24:04,333 --> 01:24:06,457
Team India. Where are our rooms?

1522
01:24:06,666 --> 01:24:09,999
Ahh... The rooms are only for the
team members, not their families...

1523
01:24:10,125 --> 01:24:10,957
Sorry, Uncle!

1524
01:24:11,083 --> 01:24:13,290
Uncle? Arrey I am a dancer.

1525
01:24:13,416 --> 01:24:14,207
Ahh... excuse me?

1526
01:24:14,291 --> 01:24:17,207
Passports, official ID papers,
Team India, Charlie.

1527
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,749
Ohh? Laila!

1528
01:24:20,291 --> 01:24:21,291
Banana?

1529
01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:23,624
Even I love bananas.
I eat 12 everyday!

1530
01:24:23,708 --> 01:24:24,708
Bananas?

1531
01:24:24,875 --> 01:24:25,749
Turn please.

1532
01:24:25,833 --> 01:24:27,790
You deaf mule it's Laila, not Banana.

1533
01:24:27,875 --> 01:24:28,540
Thank you.

1534
01:24:28,625 --> 01:24:29,625
Welcome!

1535
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:34,790
Charlie!

1536
01:24:34,958 --> 01:24:36,207
Uh? Yes?

1537
01:24:37,250 --> 01:24:38,665
An invitation from Mr. Grover.

1538
01:24:39,291 --> 01:24:40,957
There's a party tonight...

1539
01:24:41,041 --> 01:24:42,165
you'll come right?

1540
01:24:42,375 --> 01:24:43,665
- Will you come?
- Of course!

1541
01:24:43,791 --> 01:24:45,624
- So we'll be there, too.
- Great!

1542
01:24:46,125 --> 01:24:47,207
Nice bag.

1543
01:24:47,291 --> 01:24:48,291
Bag?

1544
01:24:51,750 --> 01:24:53,499
Ahh... This is nothing!

1545
01:24:53,750 --> 01:24:55,124
You haven't seen my dresses yet!

1546
01:24:57,041 --> 01:24:58,415
&^%*$♪@** - Chuck it!

1547
01:24:58,500 --> 01:25:00,624
Thank you very much.

1548
01:25:02,166 --> 01:25:04,374
Hey Chilly Chicken Wait!

1549
01:25:04,458 --> 01:25:06,082
India incoming!

1550
01:25:06,291 --> 01:25:08,374
You China. Me India. See this!

1551
01:25:08,458 --> 01:25:10,040
Aloo Paratha, Baigan Bartha,

1552
01:25:10,125 --> 01:25:12,082
Rasmalai... Karela!

1553
01:25:12,291 --> 01:25:15,165
You Chopsuey, Hakka Noodle,
Manchurian, fried rice?

1554
01:25:15,250 --> 01:25:16,957
They aren't Chinese, they are Korean.

1555
01:25:17,041 --> 01:25:19,999
Charlie, only their names are
different, but they all look the same.

1556
01:25:20,083 --> 01:25:21,749
You are extremely vulgar.

1557
01:25:21,833 --> 01:25:23,165
Thanks!

1558
01:25:30,625 --> 01:25:31,499
Hi

1559
01:25:31,583 --> 01:25:32,749
Huh?

1560
01:25:33,291 --> 01:25:34,291
Hi

1561
01:25:34,625 --> 01:25:38,332
Hi, how are you,
what is your name?

1562
01:25:38,541 --> 01:25:39,374
Oro.

1563
01:25:39,458 --> 01:25:40,499
No talking!

1564
01:25:43,500 --> 01:25:45,915
Why is he so serious?

1565
01:25:46,583 --> 01:25:48,165
Don't laugh!

1566
01:25:48,750 --> 01:25:49,582
Meaning?

1567
01:25:49,666 --> 01:25:50,790
He's saying don't laugh!

1568
01:25:57,500 --> 01:26:00,540
Charlie, if we don't
go to the party its okay...

1569
01:26:00,708 --> 01:26:02,999
We have to go...
And just the 4 of us will go.

1570
01:26:03,166 --> 01:26:04,790
We won't take Mohini & Nandu along.

1571
01:26:05,500 --> 01:26:07,707
I get why Nandu can't come...

1572
01:26:07,875 --> 01:26:10,165
because Vikki Grover will be there.
It's risky.

1573
01:26:10,291 --> 01:26:12,207
But why can't Mohini come?

1574
01:26:12,708 --> 01:26:14,832
It's not about if she can come or not?

1575
01:26:15,208 --> 01:26:17,082
It's about how she will dress up!

1576
01:26:17,250 --> 01:26:20,165
She'll wear her blingy
flashy clothes Eeee!

1577
01:26:20,541 --> 01:26:23,582
She's not a lady guys,
she's a walking talking music video!

1578
01:26:23,708 --> 01:26:25,332
- Charlie!!
- No.. no.. no, Tammy!

1579
01:26:25,458 --> 01:26:27,665
Its not about how
dramatic she is...

1580
01:26:27,791 --> 01:26:30,957
it about how she carries herself,
how she behaves, how she talks.

1581
01:26:31,750 --> 01:26:33,624
Why does she even
try talking in English?!

1582
01:26:33,708 --> 01:26:34,415
Charlie!

1583
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:35,500
1 minute!

1584
01:26:35,625 --> 01:26:37,582
If Nandu is a drunkard
from Sangam Chawl.

1585
01:26:37,666 --> 01:26:40,165
Then she too is an exotic
dancer from a bar right?

1586
01:26:40,416 --> 01:26:41,832
Yeah, what's the problem, Rohan?

1587
01:26:41,916 --> 01:26:43,582
The problem is...

1588
01:26:43,666 --> 01:26:45,707
that she is standing
behind you... Again!

1589
01:26:47,208 --> 01:26:48,999
Ahh shoot!

1590
01:26:53,166 --> 01:26:54,166
Okay?

1591
01:26:54,291 --> 01:26:56,165
I'm a drunkard? She's a dancer?

1592
01:26:56,250 --> 01:26:57,707
And you are the
prestigious upper class?!

1593
01:26:57,791 --> 01:26:59,332
What's wrong in that?

1594
01:26:59,541 --> 01:27:01,582
You're a drunkard & I'm a dancer.

1595
01:27:01,666 --> 01:27:03,415
And Charlie is the captain.

1596
01:27:04,166 --> 01:27:06,207
We'll do as he says.

1597
01:27:06,833 --> 01:27:08,874
Now, go to your room and sleep!

1598
01:27:09,875 --> 01:27:10,915
Sleep!

1599
01:27:15,541 --> 01:27:18,082
And practice tomorrow at 9 sharp!

1600
01:27:28,708 --> 01:27:30,249
Stupid!

1601
01:27:43,041 --> 01:27:45,665
Mohini don't feel
bad about Charlie's...

1602
01:27:47,750 --> 01:27:49,457
Every girl wants to...

1603
01:27:49,666 --> 01:27:52,124
be loved, respected...

1604
01:27:52,208 --> 01:27:54,124
and treated well.

1605
01:27:54,791 --> 01:27:56,915
It's nobody's childhood dream...

1606
01:27:57,083 --> 01:27:59,540
to be a dancer in a bar someday!

1607
01:28:01,583 --> 01:28:03,499
If it wasn't for my family problems..

1608
01:28:03,583 --> 01:28:06,749
I too would have gone
to an English school...

1609
01:28:07,583 --> 01:28:10,040
But fate had other plans.

1610
01:28:13,291 --> 01:28:15,082
Fate is a bloody fickle thing!

1611
01:28:17,250 --> 01:28:18,582
It can change sides anytime.

1612
01:28:19,958 --> 01:28:22,290
Don't rub salt in my wounds
by talking like Charlie...

1613
01:28:22,375 --> 01:28:24,374
Charlie is naive, Mohini...

1614
01:28:25,041 --> 01:28:27,332
He doesn't
know how to talk to a girl...

1615
01:28:28,250 --> 01:28:30,332
And you are the first girl...

1616
01:28:30,416 --> 01:28:32,332
who he likes so much...

1617
01:28:33,291 --> 01:28:34,582
He does...

1618
01:28:34,791 --> 01:28:38,040
But he's deaf in both
ears as far as love is concerned...

1619
01:28:41,083 --> 01:28:43,665
He can't hear his own heart's calling.

1620
01:28:46,500 --> 01:28:48,540
How to make him hear it then?

1621
01:28:48,750 --> 01:28:49,957
By exploding a bomb.

1622
01:28:50,250 --> 01:28:50,790
Bomb?

1623
01:28:50,875 --> 01:28:51,875
Hmm.

1624
01:28:51,916 --> 01:28:53,540
A huge bomb!

1625
01:28:54,500 --> 01:28:55,999
Mohini Bomb!

1626
01:29:12,375 --> 01:29:15,040
Excuse me

1627
01:29:16,625 --> 01:29:18,457
Hello my lovely... Muahh

1628
01:29:18,625 --> 01:29:20,665
Hey... hey... Guys.. guys.. guys...!!

1629
01:29:21,708 --> 01:29:22,708
Vikki Grover!

1630
01:29:24,625 --> 01:29:27,332
Good that drunkard
didn't come here...

1631
01:29:27,541 --> 01:29:29,165
If he was here
he would have said...

1632
01:29:29,333 --> 01:29:32,290
Hey same to same, color Xerox!

1633
01:29:32,375 --> 01:29:33,582
Ehhh! Nandu what are you doing here?!

1634
01:29:33,666 --> 01:29:35,624
I told you not to
get out of your room.

1635
01:29:36,041 --> 01:29:37,999
No Hindustani! Suit Armani!

1636
01:29:38,083 --> 01:29:40,082
You deserve to be slapped for this!

1637
01:29:40,416 --> 01:29:43,332
Free wine, in this stomach of mine...

1638
01:29:43,875 --> 01:29:46,499
Along with fried duck...

1639
01:29:46,583 --> 01:29:47,415
eat you mother...

1640
01:29:47,500 --> 01:29:49,457
Shut up! Behave yourself!

1641
01:29:49,541 --> 01:29:53,999
Put him under the table,
give him his drink, here take this!

1642
01:30:49,541 --> 01:30:50,790
How am I looking?

1643
01:30:50,958 --> 01:30:52,249
Just like a Barbie!

1644
01:30:52,333 --> 01:30:54,457
Correct... like my 'bhabhi'!
(sister-in-law)

1645
01:30:57,500 --> 01:30:58,540
Hello...

1646
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,207
What?

1647
01:31:01,791 --> 01:31:03,999
Well, hello my beauty...

1648
01:31:05,083 --> 01:31:06,249
I am Charlie.

1649
01:31:06,333 --> 01:31:07,457
Jazzed up Nandu too?

1650
01:31:07,541 --> 01:31:08,915
Yeah, team India I presume!

1651
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:10,665
Jhakkass (mind-blowing)
Nandu huh?!

1652
01:31:10,750 --> 01:31:11,750
Good stuff!

1653
01:31:11,791 --> 01:31:12,499
Jack-ass-Nandu?

1654
01:31:12,583 --> 01:31:14,665
Jackass. Yeah.

1655
01:31:14,750 --> 01:31:18,707
Nowadays we don't use terms
like handsome, dude, charming...

1656
01:31:18,791 --> 01:31:20,957
It's jackass now, right?

1657
01:31:21,291 --> 01:31:21,999
Right, Jag?

1658
01:31:22,083 --> 01:31:24,749
Right! And in India 'dudes' are
called as 'Nandu'... Jhakaas-nandu!

1659
01:31:24,833 --> 01:31:25,499
Jhakaas-nandu.

1660
01:31:25,583 --> 01:31:27,957
Yeah jhakaas-nandu, how do you do?

1661
01:31:28,208 --> 01:31:29,374
Yeah, fine.

1662
01:31:29,541 --> 01:31:31,021
How about a drink darling?
No, No, No!

1663
01:31:31,083 --> 01:31:33,082
English huh? Mind blowing, let's go!

1664
01:31:33,166 --> 01:31:35,249
Nandu, Jackass Nandu. I like it!
It's very funny.

1665
01:31:35,333 --> 01:31:36,624
Arey Mohini, ahh Mr. Jackass!!

1666
01:31:36,833 --> 01:31:37,833
I now give you,

1667
01:31:37,875 --> 01:31:40,707
the magnanimous
host for tonight's wonderful party...

1668
01:31:40,916 --> 01:31:42,874
Mr. Charan Grover!

1669
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,665
Charlie! We have to
keep a low profile now.

1670
01:32:03,916 --> 01:32:07,207
Its best if Grover
doesn't notice us.

1671
01:32:08,250 --> 01:32:10,207
Mr. Grover! Mr. Grover!

1672
01:32:10,291 --> 01:32:11,415
Team India!

1673
01:32:15,875 --> 01:32:17,290
Excuse me!

1674
01:32:18,875 --> 01:32:19,790
&^%$♪&♪...

1675
01:32:19,875 --> 01:32:21,207
Chuck it...

1676
01:32:21,708 --> 01:32:23,415
That was close!

1677
01:32:23,791 --> 01:32:24,874
Hell, No!

1678
01:32:24,958 --> 01:32:27,957
But according to me, the most
shocking team this year is...

1679
01:32:28,041 --> 01:32:29,207
Team India...

1680
01:32:33,416 --> 01:32:35,056
you must have heard about us,
surely...

1681
01:32:36,250 --> 01:32:37,874
Team India. Of course!

1682
01:32:38,416 --> 01:32:40,624
You were feeling ashamed to meet
your own people,

1683
01:32:40,750 --> 01:32:43,540
so we thought we'll
come over and say hello.

1684
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:45,290
What's the matter Mr. Grover...

1685
01:32:45,708 --> 01:32:46,708
you won't welcome us?

1686
01:32:46,750 --> 01:32:50,124
Talks of your welcome are echoing
through Dubai!

1687
01:32:51,500 --> 01:32:52,980
It must have been
quite a welcome huh?

1688
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,249
It was quite a welcome, yeah!

1689
01:32:55,750 --> 01:32:57,624
Mr. Grover,
we Indians are like this only,

1690
01:32:57,833 --> 01:33:00,457
If we like someone we give them our
hearts and make them kings,

1691
01:33:00,708 --> 01:33:02,082
and if we don't like someone...

1692
01:33:02,166 --> 01:33:03,290
then tomatoes.

1693
01:33:04,458 --> 01:33:07,332
But there's one thing Mr. Grover,
we don't look away while talking.

1694
01:33:08,083 --> 01:33:11,457
They say that people who look
away... have guilt in their hearts.

1695
01:33:11,541 --> 01:33:13,457
- Hey mister!
- Mr. Kapoor...

1696
01:33:13,541 --> 01:33:14,874
take it easy.

1697
01:33:19,708 --> 01:33:23,499
After all he is our guest,
so what if its just for a few days...

1698
01:33:24,083 --> 01:33:26,332
And we need to put
up a great show hmm?

1699
01:33:26,458 --> 01:33:28,999
Anyways going by their entry,

1700
01:33:29,208 --> 01:33:30,999
I'm 100% sure...

1701
01:33:31,083 --> 01:33:33,582
their exit will
be of another level!

1702
01:33:34,166 --> 01:33:36,165
India has a track record...

1703
01:33:36,250 --> 01:33:38,207
whether its a
team for the Olympics...

1704
01:33:38,375 --> 01:33:40,374
or a film for the Oscar..

1705
01:33:40,625 --> 01:33:43,832
They always send losers.

1706
01:33:44,833 --> 01:33:46,290
You, what were you saying?

1707
01:33:46,583 --> 01:33:47,874
Who will win WDC?

1708
01:33:48,208 --> 01:33:50,415
I don't know who'll win
but I know who'll lose...

1709
01:33:50,583 --> 01:33:52,499
I think you
should put your money on them.

1710
01:33:54,708 --> 01:33:56,415
I promise you Mr. Grover,

1711
01:33:57,500 --> 01:34:00,207
your happiness at seeing us here now,

1712
01:34:00,791 --> 01:34:02,391
will be nothing compared
to your grief...

1713
01:34:02,458 --> 01:34:03,707
once we are gone.

1714
01:34:04,375 --> 01:34:06,665
What grieves me is...

1715
01:34:06,916 --> 01:34:09,832
that out of a country
of 1 .3 billion people,

1716
01:34:10,083 --> 01:34:13,249
'these' are the people
that India has chosen.

1717
01:34:13,708 --> 01:34:15,374
Don't you worry...

1718
01:34:15,541 --> 01:34:18,290
we are enough for you guys.

1719
01:34:33,333 --> 01:34:37,082
"Hey, admit it or not."

1720
01:34:37,291 --> 01:34:42,332
"We have style,
yes we are the stars."

1721
01:34:45,250 --> 01:34:48,332
"A little bit of this
and a little bit of that."

1722
01:34:48,500 --> 01:34:53,874
"Yeah whatever you say
we are proud of who we are."

1723
01:34:56,625 --> 01:35:01,665
"Its time for the world to recognize."

1724
01:35:02,416 --> 01:35:05,540
"Or go ahead and try us on."

1725
01:35:05,625 --> 01:35:09,249
"We're cool, we're smart,
we're the kings of hearts."

1726
01:35:09,416 --> 01:35:12,957
"Call us by our names,
sing Indiawaale."

1727
01:35:13,083 --> 01:35:16,665
"We can make your hearts sing,
Indiawaale"

1728
01:35:16,750 --> 01:35:20,957
"Winning is just our thing,
Indiawaale."

1729
01:35:21,083 --> 01:35:29,083
"Do what you like,
but don't mess with the Indiawaale."

1730
01:35:54,708 --> 01:35:57,665
"We're the good guys, see?"

1731
01:35:57,833 --> 01:36:02,790
"Yeah, we do it our way
and we make our own destiny."

1732
01:36:05,750 --> 01:36:08,874
"We don't care anyway."

1733
01:36:09,083 --> 01:36:14,290
"Let them say what they want to say."

1734
01:36:15,666 --> 01:36:20,290
"Yeah we do what we feel like."

1735
01:36:21,291 --> 01:36:24,124
"Just as long as it feels right."

1736
01:36:24,416 --> 01:36:26,499
"For friends in need
we're friends indeed.."

1737
01:36:26,583 --> 01:36:28,023
"..we stand by them with our lives."

1738
01:36:28,166 --> 01:36:31,665
"Call us by our names,
sing Indiawaale."

1739
01:36:31,750 --> 01:36:35,374
"We can make your hearts sing,
Indiawaale"

1740
01:36:35,458 --> 01:36:39,665
"Winning is just our thing,
Indiawaale."

1741
01:36:39,750 --> 01:36:44,832
"Do what you like,
but don't mess with the Indiawaale."

1742
01:36:45,541 --> 01:36:50,374
"We'll wrap you around our fingers,
Indiawaale."

1743
01:37:14,041 --> 01:37:16,999
"With one look,
with just a single look."

1744
01:37:17,125 --> 01:37:22,624
"In just a moment,
we can win your heart."

1745
01:37:25,250 --> 01:37:28,249
"This whole world"

1746
01:37:28,333 --> 01:37:30,165
"Will be right at your feet."

1747
01:37:30,250 --> 01:37:32,790
"If you're the person
we choose to love."

1748
01:37:32,875 --> 01:37:38,082
"We'll gladly leave the world behind."

1749
01:37:38,458 --> 01:37:41,832
"For a space in your heart and mind."

1750
01:37:41,916 --> 01:37:43,707
"Because when we love,
we love forever."

1751
01:37:43,791 --> 01:37:45,540
"And you can say that again!"

1752
01:37:45,625 --> 01:37:49,207
"Call us by our names,
sing Indiawaale."

1753
01:37:49,458 --> 01:37:52,874
"We can make your hearts sing,
Indiawaale"

1754
01:37:53,166 --> 01:37:56,707
"Winning is just our thing,
Indiawaale."

1755
01:37:57,416 --> 01:38:02,415
"Do what you like,
but don't mess with the Indiawaale."

1756
01:38:03,083 --> 01:38:05,415
"Do what you like, but don't mess..."

1757
01:38:06,833 --> 01:38:09,249
"We'll wrap you around our fingers..."

1758
01:38:10,583 --> 01:38:15,582
"Do what you like,
but don't mess with the Indiawaale."

1759
01:38:32,083 --> 01:38:33,083
Sorry!

1760
01:38:37,333 --> 01:38:40,249
How did Nandu change
his clothes so fast?

1761
01:38:40,666 --> 01:38:41,999
What a star!

1762
01:38:42,125 --> 01:38:45,207
I feel so good after throwing up...

1763
01:38:46,791 --> 01:38:47,832
Stop Burping!

1764
01:38:47,916 --> 01:38:48,916
Bloody pig!

1765
01:38:49,125 --> 01:38:50,582
I told you not to get this drunkard!

1766
01:38:50,875 --> 01:38:52,624
And I told you not to leave him alone.

1767
01:38:52,916 --> 01:38:53,707
It's all your fault!

1768
01:38:53,875 --> 01:38:55,290
What? My fault?

1769
01:38:55,708 --> 01:38:57,040
Why did you come to the party?

1770
01:38:57,125 --> 01:38:58,749
Rubbish!

1771
01:38:58,833 --> 01:39:02,540
Firstly, you didn't take care of me,
and now you're fighting with Charlie?

1772
01:39:02,750 --> 01:39:06,290
Think loudly,
this deaf mule didn't hear a word.

1773
01:39:06,458 --> 01:39:07,665
Rubbish!

1774
01:39:08,041 --> 01:39:11,790
Firstly, you didn't take care of me,
and now you're fighting with Charlie?

1775
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,082
I'd love to fight
& get physical with him.

1776
01:39:14,166 --> 01:39:15,166
You Shut up!

1777
01:39:15,250 --> 01:39:16,665
You pant down!

1778
01:39:16,833 --> 01:39:18,665
Shhh! Guys!

1779
01:39:18,750 --> 01:39:21,082
Don't think so loudly.

1780
01:39:21,166 --> 01:39:22,457
Mohini will hear us!

1781
01:39:23,041 --> 01:39:28,749
I'm more beautiful
now by saying your name...

1782
01:39:28,916 --> 01:39:33,457
Your name...

1783
01:39:35,250 --> 01:39:37,457
Mohini! Your floor is here.

1784
01:39:37,625 --> 01:39:40,040
That was quick!

1785
01:39:40,833 --> 01:39:42,082
I want to...

1786
01:39:42,208 --> 01:39:43,749
Eat you!

1787
01:39:44,750 --> 01:39:46,374
Good nights!

1788
01:39:47,708 --> 01:39:49,624
Not a word guys!

1789
01:39:50,125 --> 01:39:52,374
Not.. a.. word!

1790
01:39:52,458 --> 01:39:54,915
Tomorrow,
I want to go over the plan again.

1791
01:39:58,666 --> 01:40:00,624
Gentlemen!
Welcome to Mission Merry Christmas!

1792
01:40:01,541 --> 01:40:04,249
The Diamonds will be in Shalimar by
tomorrow evening.

1793
01:40:04,333 --> 01:40:05,665
Understood?

1794
01:40:07,750 --> 01:40:09,874
Very good, Tammy.
Rohan continue...

1795
01:40:09,916 --> 01:40:12,415
Starting point of the mission
Room 9C.

1796
01:40:12,500 --> 01:40:15,415
Problem is, this room can be
allotted to anyone.

1797
01:40:15,916 --> 01:40:17,915
But I have allotted room 9C...

1798
01:40:18,041 --> 01:40:19,124
to team India!

1799
01:40:23,666 --> 01:40:26,040
We are performing
3rd in the semi finals.

1800
01:40:26,125 --> 01:40:28,124
There are 5 more
performances after us.

1801
01:40:28,166 --> 01:40:31,499
Which means we have a lot of time to
rob the diamonds.

1802
01:40:31,583 --> 01:40:32,665
Go get them!

1803
01:40:33,125 --> 01:40:35,540
We will go on stage and perform.

1804
01:40:39,500 --> 01:40:42,415
And the audience will go bananas.

1805
01:40:42,458 --> 01:40:44,665
Story is over. Enjoy.

1806
01:40:45,125 --> 01:40:47,790
After our awful dance...

1807
01:40:47,916 --> 01:40:50,249
me and Charlie will
get into the duct.

1808
01:40:50,291 --> 01:40:52,040
- Aabraa...
- Ka Dabraa!

1809
01:40:53,791 --> 01:40:56,915
While I call Vikki Grover to lift.

1810
01:40:59,916 --> 01:41:01,665
It's a piece of cake!

1811
01:41:03,375 --> 01:41:03,957
Hello?

1812
01:41:04,041 --> 01:41:07,124
Hello Mr. Vikki?... Blah blah blah...
Elevator 3. Come quick.

1813
01:41:07,166 --> 01:41:08,915
OK sir, right away!

1814
01:41:10,291 --> 01:41:13,790
2 seconds after entering the lift,
Vikki is of no use to us.

1815
01:41:20,333 --> 01:41:21,790
What we need...

1816
01:41:21,916 --> 01:41:23,290
are his fingerprints.

1817
01:41:29,625 --> 01:41:30,999
Fooled you didn't I?

1818
01:41:31,083 --> 01:41:33,165
I'm not Vikki! I am Nandu Bhide!

1819
01:41:33,250 --> 01:41:37,374
Nandu Bhide is the Man!
Now you watching me speaking English!

1820
01:41:37,958 --> 01:41:39,249
English. English English!

1821
01:41:39,291 --> 01:41:40,165
English. English. English!

1822
01:41:40,291 --> 01:41:42,249
Let's open the biometric now.

1823
01:41:45,375 --> 01:41:47,249
Aabraa Ka Daabraa!

1824
01:41:48,291 --> 01:41:50,290
Meanwhile, Charlie & Fatso...

1825
01:41:50,375 --> 01:41:52,040
will reach the
other side of the Duct.

1826
01:41:52,125 --> 01:41:56,540
Which I will open with my Allen key.

1827
01:41:56,791 --> 01:41:58,624
Charlie & fatso will come in...

1828
01:41:58,708 --> 01:42:00,665
Abraa ka Dabraa, Part 2!

1829
01:42:04,791 --> 01:42:05,832
Well done soldier!

1830
01:42:05,916 --> 01:42:07,915
Our mission is a
success because of you!

1831
01:42:11,666 --> 01:42:14,165
I will take Charlie
& Tammy ahead from here...

1832
01:42:14,625 --> 01:42:17,124
by disabling the laser shield!

1833
01:42:23,333 --> 01:42:26,124
From here, the story is very romantic!

1834
01:42:26,375 --> 01:42:28,165
Temhton Irani's Magic fingers...

1835
01:42:28,250 --> 01:42:30,040
and Shalimar's safe!

1836
01:42:37,791 --> 01:42:39,499
Ho! Ho! Ho!

1837
01:42:43,250 --> 01:42:46,290
Mission Merry Christmas!

1838
01:42:47,916 --> 01:42:50,165
Uh, I have a doubt...

1839
01:42:50,416 --> 01:42:53,415
You'll get in with Nandu's help...

1840
01:42:53,916 --> 01:42:55,499
but how will you get out?

1841
01:42:55,583 --> 01:42:58,040
Just like the way we went in!

1842
01:42:58,166 --> 01:42:59,290
No, Tammy...

1843
01:42:59,375 --> 01:43:01,999
We can't go out the same
way we come in.

1844
01:43:02,166 --> 01:43:04,457
Shalimar is 150
feet below the ground..

1845
01:43:04,541 --> 01:43:06,624
We can go down the duct,

1846
01:43:06,666 --> 01:43:08,707
but we can't climb back up. No.

1847
01:43:08,791 --> 01:43:11,415
But, Charlie, if you don't get out
within 5 minutes,

1848
01:43:11,500 --> 01:43:13,915
the safe auto-locks itself..

1849
01:43:14,125 --> 01:43:15,832
With you inside it!

1850
01:43:16,625 --> 01:43:18,624
The walls are 6 inches of steel!

1851
01:43:18,666 --> 01:43:21,457
And the mesh below has space enough
only for oxygen pipes.

1852
01:43:21,541 --> 01:43:22,541
How will we get out?

1853
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:26,040
Mummmaaaaaaa!!!!

1854
01:43:27,750 --> 01:43:30,915
How are we going to get out, Idiots!

1855
01:43:31,291 --> 01:43:32,207
Jag will get us out.

1856
01:43:32,291 --> 01:43:33,582
This deaf donkey?

1857
01:43:33,666 --> 01:43:36,124
What did you think fatso?
Am just a handsome face?

1858
01:43:36,166 --> 01:43:37,374
Who told you you're handsome?

1859
01:43:37,458 --> 01:43:38,457
Who told you you'll get out?

1860
01:43:38,541 --> 01:43:40,040
Who told you you're not handsome?

1861
01:43:40,375 --> 01:43:42,790
Someone tell me how
we getting out please?

1862
01:43:42,875 --> 01:43:43,875
Tammy...

1863
01:43:44,291 --> 01:43:45,915
I told you Jag will get us out.

1864
01:43:46,041 --> 01:43:47,165
You don't trust me?

1865
01:43:47,250 --> 01:43:48,665
I'm going to be there too!

1866
01:43:48,750 --> 01:43:50,040
You'll be taken care of.

1867
01:43:50,166 --> 01:43:53,124
Okay, you two tell me plan.

1868
01:43:53,291 --> 01:43:54,415
Captain Charlie!

1869
01:43:54,666 --> 01:43:56,665
We will get out of
Shalimar and meet at room 9C.

1870
01:43:56,750 --> 01:43:59,165
And we will sulk while we wait for
the bad news!

1871
01:43:59,250 --> 01:44:00,250
Bad news!

1872
01:44:00,500 --> 01:44:02,124
Team India, you are eliminated.

1873
01:44:02,416 --> 01:44:03,540
Oh no.

1874
01:44:03,958 --> 01:44:06,499
The rules of the competition
are that the losing team...

1875
01:44:06,583 --> 01:44:09,124
will be escorted to
the airport with their baggage...

1876
01:44:09,291 --> 01:44:11,832
by the organizers personally.

1877
01:44:12,291 --> 01:44:13,291
Bye!

1878
01:44:13,416 --> 01:44:15,790
And we will fly back
to India with the diamonds.

1879
01:44:15,833 --> 01:44:17,249
And airport security?

1880
01:44:36,250 --> 01:44:37,665
What are you guys doing?

1881
01:44:37,750 --> 01:44:39,249
Common stand up guys, stand up.

1882
01:44:39,291 --> 01:44:40,291
What's going on?

1883
01:44:40,916 --> 01:44:42,790
So proud of you, Charlie.

1884
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:44,582
Genius!! Pure Genius!

1885
01:44:44,666 --> 01:44:46,415
Dad used to say... Keep it simple.

1886
01:44:46,541 --> 01:44:47,290
Very simple!

1887
01:44:47,416 --> 01:44:48,915
Alright? Come on ladies!

1888
01:44:49,291 --> 01:44:49,999
Nandu?

1889
01:44:50,041 --> 01:44:51,041
- Huh?
- Up!

1890
01:44:51,750 --> 01:44:52,665
Ladies!

1891
01:44:52,750 --> 01:44:54,415
Let's go practice!

1892
01:45:05,791 --> 01:45:09,290
Make sure Nandu doesn't come here
and misbehave like last night.

1893
01:45:09,416 --> 01:45:09,749
Right!

1894
01:45:09,833 --> 01:45:11,499
Night, not right!
Of course, night...

1895
01:45:11,625 --> 01:45:13,665
don't worry he's
throwing up in the room.

1896
01:45:13,750 --> 01:45:15,165
Mohini's taking care of him.

1897
01:45:15,250 --> 01:45:19,040
OK everyone, We have to act like
we are rehearsing.

1898
01:45:19,125 --> 01:45:19,790
Tammy, you lead.

1899
01:45:19,875 --> 01:45:21,415
Okay, with the right!

1900
01:45:21,833 --> 01:45:23,165
Myeongseong!

1901
01:45:24,916 --> 01:45:25,790
Tradition!

1902
01:45:25,875 --> 01:45:26,915
Jeontong!

1903
01:45:27,416 --> 01:45:28,249
Excellence.

1904
01:45:28,333 --> 01:45:29,999
Jing-ye!

1905
01:45:30,125 --> 01:45:31,665
Discipline.

1906
01:45:32,625 --> 01:45:33,999
Koreans have such words too.

1907
01:45:44,791 --> 01:45:47,249
You're going to get it from me!

1908
01:45:49,666 --> 01:45:51,040
He's a kid.

1909
01:45:51,375 --> 01:45:53,040
Let him be alright.

1910
01:45:53,708 --> 01:45:54,708
Hey.

1911
01:45:55,541 --> 01:45:56,374
What?

1912
01:45:56,416 --> 01:45:57,665
My team.

1913
01:45:58,000 --> 01:45:58,540
Hey!

1914
01:45:58,875 --> 01:46:00,040
My style.

1915
01:46:07,500 --> 01:46:08,665
- Charlie.
- Charlie!

1916
01:46:08,791 --> 01:46:09,499
You hurt?

1917
01:46:09,541 --> 01:46:10,749
No...

1918
01:46:11,125 --> 01:46:13,290
But my favorite glares broke.

1919
01:46:13,791 --> 01:46:15,415
- I'll get a new one.
- Okay.

1920
01:46:19,250 --> 01:46:20,499
Hey you!

1921
01:46:20,750 --> 01:46:21,999
Glares!

1922
01:47:10,541 --> 01:47:12,665
This Bruce Lee is thrashing him!

1923
01:47:12,750 --> 01:47:15,249
See what our Jackie Chan does now!

1924
01:47:24,250 --> 01:47:32,250
"Just see the Kung fu power."

1925
01:47:44,791 --> 01:47:45,791
Hey Tammy.

1926
01:48:08,041 --> 01:48:09,665
Wow!

1927
01:48:13,541 --> 01:48:18,040
The fight isn't over yet, my friend!

1928
01:48:19,166 --> 01:48:20,415
No!

1929
01:48:37,250 --> 01:48:38,665
Sir, should we stop them?

1930
01:48:39,291 --> 01:48:40,291
No.

1931
01:48:41,375 --> 01:48:46,124
Put India against Korea in
tomorrow's semi final dance off.

1932
01:48:46,291 --> 01:48:48,832
Sir Korea's the best
team and India's the worst.

1933
01:48:48,916 --> 01:48:50,832
India will get eliminated
in the first round itself!

1934
01:48:50,916 --> 01:48:52,249
Exactly...

1935
01:48:53,250 --> 01:48:54,415
do it!

1936
01:49:16,125 --> 01:49:17,790
Hey, Charlie.

1937
01:49:27,250 --> 01:49:29,249
Charlie, come on.

1938
01:49:31,833 --> 01:49:33,749
Charlie. Come up.

1939
01:49:42,458 --> 01:49:43,665
Charlie, be careful.

1940
01:49:49,125 --> 01:49:50,749
Charlie! Hey, Charlie.

1941
01:49:54,666 --> 01:49:56,165
Hey, Charlie.

1942
01:50:17,041 --> 01:50:18,124
Charlie!

1943
01:50:18,166 --> 01:50:20,624
Hey, Charlie, leave him.

1944
01:50:21,666 --> 01:50:23,999
Leave his hand.

1945
01:50:37,416 --> 01:50:41,915
Good evening ladies and gentlemen!
I'm your host Dino Morea.

1946
01:50:42,125 --> 01:50:47,040
Welcome to the final word
in the world of dance, the Videocon...

1947
01:50:47,375 --> 01:50:51,665
World dance championship!

1948
01:50:52,500 --> 01:50:56,665
In the semi finals, 16 teams will compete
against each other, one on one...

1949
01:50:56,750 --> 01:50:59,915
Of which 8 teams will go through.

1950
01:51:00,041 --> 01:51:04,874
These teams will be selected by our
panel of international judges.

1951
01:51:05,166 --> 01:51:09,165
So put your hands together
for the first dance off between...

1952
01:51:09,291 --> 01:51:12,040
Team Mexico and Team Russia.

1953
01:51:30,166 --> 01:51:32,165
How many times have
I told you right hand!

1954
01:51:32,250 --> 01:51:33,790
How does it matter which hand?

1955
01:51:33,916 --> 01:51:35,165
We are going to lose anyway!

1956
01:51:35,250 --> 01:51:37,040
Hey! It matters!

1957
01:51:37,166 --> 01:51:39,540
If you lose you lose,
but don't lose your respect!

1958
01:51:39,625 --> 01:51:41,957
And I'll break your legs
if you do your snake dance again.

1959
01:51:42,041 --> 01:51:44,121
Don't say anything about my snake dance...
Shut up!

1960
01:51:44,250 --> 01:51:45,250
- Tammy uncle!
- Yes, yes!

1961
01:51:45,291 --> 01:51:46,915
Please lift Rohan properly today.

1962
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:48,415
All lectures for us?

1963
01:51:48,541 --> 01:51:50,540
Nothing for Charlie?

1964
01:51:50,916 --> 01:51:51,916
I'm telling him too...

1965
01:51:51,958 --> 01:51:53,165
Excuse me!

1966
01:51:54,375 --> 01:51:55,375
Yeah?

1967
01:51:56,541 --> 01:51:58,790
Take care of...

1968
01:51:59,666 --> 01:52:01,165
your timing please!

1969
01:52:04,291 --> 01:52:05,540
Sure!

1970
01:52:10,416 --> 01:52:11,790
I feel really bad for her!

1971
01:52:12,166 --> 01:52:14,624
She's the only
one worried about the competition.

1972
01:52:14,708 --> 01:52:16,790
Jag, Focus! Guys!

1973
01:52:43,125 --> 01:52:43,999
Wow!

1974
01:52:44,041 --> 01:52:45,999
What a brilliant performance!

1975
01:52:46,125 --> 01:52:48,832
The next dance off is between...

1976
01:52:48,916 --> 01:52:53,040
a country that's reached
here for the first time, my country-

1977
01:52:53,166 --> 01:52:56,249
Team India!

1978
01:52:56,875 --> 01:53:01,499
And the number one team of WDC,
the defending champions-

1979
01:53:01,541 --> 01:53:05,040
Team Korea!

1980
01:53:11,666 --> 01:53:15,040
"Step ahead, let's see..."

1981
01:53:15,250 --> 01:53:18,957
"Who is Faster, Fitter & Stronger!"

1982
01:53:19,041 --> 01:53:22,499
"Put your best foot forward,"

1983
01:53:22,666 --> 01:53:26,374
"My Friend!"

1984
01:53:36,416 --> 01:53:40,790
"Don't know dancing
and blames the platform."

1985
01:53:40,833 --> 01:53:44,540
"Getting happy acting stupid."

1986
01:53:44,625 --> 01:53:46,915
"Buffalo is going in the water."

1987
01:53:47,041 --> 01:53:48,161
Buffalo's gone in the water!

1988
01:53:48,208 --> 01:53:55,165
"If you are a hero, I am superhero."

1989
01:53:55,291 --> 01:54:03,291
"I am feeling alright because
it is night of nonsense."

1990
01:54:09,625 --> 01:54:11,040
Come on.

1991
01:54:17,166 --> 01:54:20,874
"How will a stupid know
the value of diamonds?"

1992
01:54:20,916 --> 01:54:22,540
"How will he?"

1993
01:54:22,625 --> 01:54:26,874
"No one notices if you
dance well in your room."

1994
01:54:28,625 --> 01:54:33,999
"One, who has power, is the king."

1995
01:54:34,041 --> 01:54:38,124
But remember,
100 Goldsmiths equals 1 blacksmith!

1996
01:54:38,291 --> 01:54:39,165
Meaning?

1997
01:54:39,250 --> 01:54:41,082
100 Goldsmiths = 1 Blacksmith!

1998
01:54:41,333 --> 01:54:49,333
Wah wah!

1999
01:54:49,916 --> 01:54:57,916
"I am feeling alright because it
is night of nonsense."

2000
01:55:04,416 --> 01:55:08,040
Come on.
"All is well that ends well."

2001
01:55:08,416 --> 01:55:16,416
"All is well that ends well."

2002
01:55:20,458 --> 01:55:28,458
"I am feeling alright because it
is night of nonsense."

2003
01:56:20,166 --> 01:56:22,165
Hey.. Charlie.

2004
01:56:22,916 --> 01:56:24,290
Charlie are you alright?

2005
01:56:25,291 --> 01:56:27,540
Charlie.. are you alright?

2006
01:56:27,625 --> 01:56:28,999
He fell down from such a height.

2007
01:56:35,375 --> 01:56:43,375
India! India!

2008
01:56:47,750 --> 01:56:48,915
Guys let's go.

2009
01:56:51,958 --> 01:56:52,790
Mohini, Mohini.

2010
01:56:52,875 --> 01:56:55,957
We are Sorry! Tammy
got fits, Nandu went mad...

2011
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,999
and I messed up completely.

2012
01:57:00,791 --> 01:57:02,124
I am sorry...

2013
01:57:03,375 --> 01:57:05,040
we lost our respect.

2014
01:57:05,291 --> 01:57:06,999
No, Charlie!

2015
01:57:07,291 --> 01:57:10,665
It doesn't matter if we
lose today...

2016
01:57:11,375 --> 01:57:14,040
Because you won
everyone's hearts.

2017
01:57:17,125 --> 01:57:18,540
Charlie, take this...

2018
01:57:18,625 --> 01:57:19,915
Key to room 9C.

2019
01:57:21,083 --> 01:57:22,915
See you here in an hour?

2020
01:57:23,041 --> 01:57:24,665
Uh yes I'll see you here.

2021
01:57:24,791 --> 01:57:26,040
Why after an hour?

2022
01:57:26,291 --> 01:57:27,415
Lets all sit together.

2023
01:57:28,041 --> 01:57:29,281
Mohini wants to sit together...

2024
01:57:29,291 --> 01:57:30,665
No.. no.. we can't do that...

2025
01:57:30,875 --> 01:57:33,915
I'll go drop Tammy to
his room else he'll collapse.

2026
01:57:34,166 --> 01:57:35,406
I'll go take a shower and come.

2027
01:57:35,541 --> 01:57:37,124
Shower, you?

2028
01:57:37,416 --> 01:57:38,624
What's cooking guys?

2029
01:57:38,666 --> 01:57:40,624
Actually, Mohini...

2030
01:57:40,916 --> 01:57:42,540
I need to use this green room.

2031
01:57:42,666 --> 01:57:44,374
Someone's coming to meet me...

2032
01:57:44,875 --> 01:57:46,124
Laila's coming.

2033
01:57:47,041 --> 01:57:48,290
Laila?

2034
01:57:53,375 --> 01:57:54,915
Shhh... Mohini?

2035
01:57:55,458 --> 01:57:56,915
Come on, let's go.

2036
01:57:57,041 --> 01:57:59,374
Come on, let's hurry up!

2037
01:58:00,041 --> 01:58:01,290
Common guys!

2038
01:58:02,625 --> 01:58:03,790
Guys, it's a go!

2039
01:58:03,916 --> 01:58:04,790
Rohan?

2040
01:58:04,875 --> 01:58:05,915
Tammy, here!

2041
01:58:06,041 --> 01:58:07,915
Jag, Nandu, wear your burqas quick!

2042
01:58:08,041 --> 01:58:09,374
Quick.. quick.. quick.. everyone.

2043
01:58:22,791 --> 01:58:25,552
Keep a walkie on an open channel
so everyone can hear what's going on.

2044
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,040
Aunty can you tie this for me please.

2045
01:58:31,666 --> 01:58:34,040
Jag, Nandu.
Get to the lift, quick!

2046
01:58:34,291 --> 01:58:35,499
- Ready, sister?
- Yes.

2047
01:58:44,416 --> 01:58:45,165
Rohan...

2048
01:58:45,250 --> 01:58:46,665
call up Vikki Grover.

2049
01:58:49,833 --> 01:58:50,457
Yeah?

2050
01:58:50,500 --> 01:58:51,790
Hello Mr. Vikki?

2051
01:58:51,833 --> 01:58:53,624
This is security
chief Alfredo speaking!

2052
01:58:53,666 --> 01:58:54,207
Who?

2053
01:58:54,291 --> 01:58:56,915
Come urgently.
Room 2205. Beautiful girl.

2054
01:58:57,041 --> 01:58:58,915
Very pregnant. Calling you now!!

2055
01:58:59,125 --> 01:58:59,832
What?

2056
01:58:59,916 --> 01:59:01,124
Are you coming? Or I call daddy?

2057
01:59:01,166 --> 01:59:03,749
No.. no..
No! Don't call dad! I'm coming!

2058
01:59:13,750 --> 01:59:14,790
Yes?

2059
01:59:15,416 --> 01:59:18,040
No, no, no, no. Rain check on
tomorrow's meeting.

2060
01:59:18,166 --> 01:59:19,624
There has been a change in plan.

2061
01:59:19,708 --> 01:59:21,540
Dad's going to
Pretoria tomorrow.

2062
01:59:21,750 --> 01:59:23,624
Shhh... Tammy, one minute.

2063
01:59:24,125 --> 01:59:25,540
Why is Grover going to Pretoria?

2064
01:59:26,291 --> 01:59:27,915
The diamonds should have
come from Pretoria by now.

2065
01:59:28,083 --> 01:59:29,165
Means?

2066
01:59:30,166 --> 01:59:32,624
Does that mean that the diamonds
haven't reached here yet?

2067
01:59:32,791 --> 01:59:35,499
Exactly! Oh you know, Customs!

2068
01:59:35,625 --> 01:59:38,040
This paper that paper...
All really very painful.

2069
01:59:38,250 --> 01:59:39,810
Diamonds were supposed
to come tonight..

2070
01:59:39,916 --> 01:59:41,707
But now they will
come on 31st December.

2071
01:59:42,750 --> 01:59:43,249
Damn!

2072
01:59:43,333 --> 01:59:44,333
What?

2073
01:59:44,916 --> 01:59:46,749
Yes, I know, it's New Year's Eve!

2074
01:59:46,791 --> 01:59:48,624
And the finals of WDC!

2075
01:59:48,666 --> 01:59:51,040
It's gonna be chaotic with a big K.

2076
01:59:51,416 --> 01:59:52,290
Okay...

2077
01:59:52,416 --> 01:59:53,416
See you!

2078
01:59:54,291 --> 01:59:55,291
Tammy?

2079
01:59:55,500 --> 01:59:56,500
Damn!

2080
02:00:06,208 --> 02:00:07,499
Shit Man!

2081
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,915
It took us 6 months to...
Not 6 months, Rohan...

2082
02:00:11,625 --> 02:00:15,499
8 years!

2083
02:00:16,583 --> 02:00:19,915
I have been fanning this
fire in my heart since 8 years!

2084
02:00:20,250 --> 02:00:21,665
I have prayed for this,

2085
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:23,624
hoped for this, yearned for this day,

2086
02:00:24,833 --> 02:00:27,999
When I see Charan Grover destroyed.

2087
02:00:30,250 --> 02:00:32,540
And today after 8 years,
that day had come!

2088
02:00:34,666 --> 02:00:36,249
The perfect day.

2089
02:00:36,750 --> 02:00:37,874
The perfect plan.

2090
02:00:37,958 --> 02:00:41,415
The perfect revenge!
The perfect everything!

2091
02:00:42,541 --> 02:00:44,499
We have reached here..

2092
02:00:45,541 --> 02:00:50,040
And according to the plan we will
be leaving in the next 10 minutes..

2093
02:00:55,291 --> 02:00:56,790
But empty handed.

2094
02:00:59,416 --> 02:01:00,665
Mohini!

2095
02:01:01,250 --> 02:01:02,290
Guys!

2096
02:01:13,125 --> 02:01:14,790
They are calling us for the results.

2097
02:01:16,125 --> 02:01:17,125
Yaa...

2098
02:01:30,541 --> 02:01:33,415
Ladies & Gentlemen, it's time!

2099
02:01:33,750 --> 02:01:36,999
The results of the semi finals are
in my hands.

2100
02:01:37,166 --> 02:01:40,665
Out of the 16 teams
that performed,

2101
02:01:40,791 --> 02:01:42,165
only 8 winning Teams...

2102
02:01:42,291 --> 02:01:45,415
will go through to the
finals to be held on new years eve.

2103
02:01:45,916 --> 02:01:50,874
The losers unfortunately will spend
their Christmas on a flight back home.

2104
02:01:52,666 --> 02:01:55,665
And the 8 lucky teams are..

2105
02:01:56,250 --> 02:01:57,790
Spain!

2106
02:01:59,500 --> 02:02:01,249
Congratulations, Team Spain!

2107
02:02:01,416 --> 02:02:03,165
Our next finalist is-

2108
02:02:03,333 --> 02:02:04,415

The next finalist-

2110
02:02:06,791 --> 02:02:07,999

02:02:20,125 --> 02:02:21,790
And now we have...

2115
02:02:21,875 --> 02:02:23,124
Team USA!

2116
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:26,874
Well done team USA!

2117
02:02:27,041 --> 02:02:32,040
And the last team
to reach the finals is,

2118
02:02:36,916 --> 02:02:38,290
Team-

2119
02:02:38,541 --> 02:02:40,540
Korea!

2120
02:02:46,458 --> 02:02:49,624
These are our 8 finalists.

2121
02:02:49,916 --> 02:02:51,540
Thank you very much
for everything and...

2122
02:02:51,666 --> 02:02:54,999
we shall now see
you next on new year's eve.

2123
02:02:56,166 --> 02:02:58,165
We judges would like to make an
announcement.

2124
02:02:58,291 --> 02:02:59,915
Ladies and gentlemen...

2125
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:01,415
contestants.

2126
02:03:01,875 --> 02:03:03,999
Our judges would
like to say something.

2127
02:03:04,375 --> 02:03:05,615
This is a special announcement.

2128
02:03:05,666 --> 02:03:06,790
Guys, guys.

2129
02:03:06,875 --> 02:03:07,999
Listen up!

2130
02:03:08,666 --> 02:03:09,874
Thank you.

2131
02:03:18,916 --> 02:03:21,040
Today on this stage...

2132
02:03:21,083 --> 02:03:22,999
we saw something
that hasn't happened...

2133
02:03:23,041 --> 02:03:26,749
in the 10 year history of the world
dance championship...

2134
02:03:27,041 --> 02:03:29,665
In the 10 years of WDC this
has never happened before.

2135
02:03:29,750 --> 02:03:33,249
A rare display of colossal courage
and sporting spirit.

2136
02:03:33,291 --> 02:03:36,290
A rare display of colossal courage
and sporting spirit,

2137
02:03:36,500 --> 02:03:38,415
We bow our heads in respect.

2138
02:03:38,541 --> 02:03:39,665
We salute them.

2139
02:03:39,750 --> 02:03:42,999
All of us together, salute this Team!

2140
02:03:43,416 --> 02:03:46,124
This team took a huge risk.

2141
02:03:46,541 --> 02:03:48,040
They put their performance second.

2142
02:03:48,166 --> 02:03:50,290
This team was extremely daring...

2143
02:03:50,541 --> 02:03:51,874
took a risk!

2144
02:03:51,958 --> 02:03:56,665
They gave up on their own
performance to help a rival team.

2145
02:03:56,916 --> 02:04:00,165
For another rival team, they
gave up on their own performance.

2146
02:04:00,250 --> 02:04:03,999
This quality must be rewarded.

2147
02:04:04,125 --> 02:04:08,624
Because the spirit of dance is so
much greater than any technique!

2148
02:04:09,083 --> 02:04:12,790
We believe the world would
not want to see this team go home yet.

2149
02:04:13,083 --> 02:04:16,540
So we the judges have decided
they deserve a second chance.

2150
02:04:16,583 --> 02:04:19,790
So the judges have decided...

2151
02:04:20,166 --> 02:04:22,999
that they should
get another chance.

2152
02:04:23,458 --> 02:04:28,540
So hold on to your hearts
for the first time ever...

2153
02:04:28,875 --> 02:04:31,040
a wild card entry...

2154
02:04:31,291 --> 02:04:35,249
into the finals of
the World Dance Championship...

2155
02:04:35,791 --> 02:04:37,040
Is Team...

2156
02:04:37,125 --> 02:04:39,040
INDIA!

2157
02:05:29,916 --> 02:05:32,540
Huh?

2158
02:05:32,875 --> 02:05:33,999
Wake up! Wake up!

2159
02:05:34,666 --> 02:05:35,707
Hey fatso!

2160
02:05:35,791 --> 02:05:36,915
See this!

2161
02:05:39,916 --> 02:05:43,165
Hey..

2162
02:05:43,416 --> 02:05:51,416
Radhe, Radhe! Hail Lord Krishna!

2163
02:05:54,625 --> 02:05:56,957
Breaking news,
Team India are in the finals!

2164
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:58,290
Team India you beauty!

2165
02:05:59,750 --> 02:06:01,249
Wo, Team India has..

2166
02:06:01,416 --> 02:06:02,665
Team India!

2167
02:06:02,791 --> 02:06:04,290
We are proud of Team India..

2168
02:06:04,541 --> 02:06:05,541
Wow.

2169
02:06:05,791 --> 02:06:06,915
Good days are here!

2170
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:08,124
Hail Lord Krishna.

2171
02:06:08,166 --> 02:06:11,540
"Look, I don't mean to be rude."

2172
02:06:11,750 --> 02:06:15,124
"But life is like a good
girl with a bad attitude."

2173
02:06:15,250 --> 02:06:18,749
"Damn I tried so hard,
gave it all I could."

2174
02:06:18,791 --> 02:06:22,665
"Finally,
now she looks at me like she should!"

2175
02:06:25,875 --> 02:06:27,790
"My mind's gone bonkers!"

2176
02:06:27,833 --> 02:06:29,374
"A little bonkers!"

2177
02:06:29,458 --> 02:06:32,540
"As luck is favoring me"

2178
02:06:32,875 --> 02:06:34,749
"My mind's gone bonkers!"

2179
02:06:34,791 --> 02:06:36,457
"Completely, utterly bonkers!"

2180
02:06:36,541 --> 02:06:39,665
"Ohh yeah... yeah... yeah"

2181
02:06:39,916 --> 02:06:41,790
"My mind's gone bonkers!"

2182
02:06:41,916 --> 02:06:43,499
"A little bonkers!"

2183
02:06:43,541 --> 02:06:46,540
"As luck is favoring me"

2184
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:48,749
"My mind's gone bonkers!"

2185
02:06:48,833 --> 02:06:50,624
"Completely, utterly bonkers!"

2186
02:06:50,750 --> 02:06:53,874
"Ohh yeah... yeah... yeah"

2187
02:07:15,291 --> 02:07:23,291
"Radhe, Radhe,
Hail Lord Krishna."

2188
02:07:29,500 --> 02:07:31,999
"She is so simple,"

2189
02:07:32,583 --> 02:07:36,124
"But she knows exactly
what she is looking for"

2190
02:07:36,166 --> 02:07:39,290
"If I could ever have her"

2191
02:07:39,541 --> 02:07:43,499
"I know she is exactly
what I'm searching for."

2192
02:07:43,541 --> 02:07:45,207
"She is what I need!"

2193
02:07:45,291 --> 02:07:46,915
"But so hard to read"

2194
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:48,749
"She's complicated"

2195
02:07:48,791 --> 02:07:50,499
"I'm intoxicated"

2196
02:07:50,583 --> 02:07:54,624
"I drained the bottle
not a drop left behind."

2197
02:07:55,458 --> 02:07:59,624
"My mind's gone bonkers!"

2198
02:07:59,666 --> 02:08:01,082
"A little bonkers!"

2199
02:08:01,166 --> 02:08:04,249
"As luck is favoring me"

2200
02:08:04,625 --> 02:08:06,290
"My mind's gone bonkers!"

2201
02:08:06,416 --> 02:08:08,040
"Completely, utterly bonkers!"

2202
02:08:08,166 --> 02:08:11,540
"Oh yeah, oh yeah.."

2203
02:08:11,750 --> 02:08:13,999
Mohini Joshi's School of dance..

2204
02:08:14,333 --> 02:08:16,040
For small children,

2205
02:08:16,166 --> 02:08:19,249
so that when a 6 year old dances,
its out of passion..

2206
02:08:19,625 --> 02:08:20,790
Not compulsion.

2207
02:08:23,291 --> 02:08:26,874
How have you become so popular?
Are you ready for the finals?

2208
02:08:40,041 --> 02:08:41,790
"She is a little sweet."

2209
02:08:41,833 --> 02:08:43,540
"And a little spicy."

2210
02:08:43,625 --> 02:08:46,874
"Just to make her smile,
I'd walk forever and a mile."

2211
02:08:46,958 --> 02:08:50,249
"Damn I tried so hard,
gave it all I could."

2212
02:08:50,333 --> 02:08:54,124
"Finally,
now she looks at me like she should!"

2213
02:08:54,208 --> 02:08:55,874
"My mind's gone bonkers!"

2214
02:08:55,958 --> 02:08:57,665
"A little bonkers!"

2215
02:08:57,750 --> 02:09:00,665
"As luck is favoring me."

2216
02:09:01,250 --> 02:09:02,957
"My mind's gone bonkers!"

2217
02:09:03,041 --> 02:09:04,707
"Completely, utterly bonkers!"

2218
02:09:04,791 --> 02:09:07,915
"Ohh yeah, ohh yeah... Ohh yeah"

2219
02:09:08,166 --> 02:09:16,166
"Radhe, Radhe, Hail Lord Krishna."

2220
02:09:18,916 --> 02:09:20,124
"My mind's gone bonkers!"

2221
02:09:20,208 --> 02:09:21,957
"A little bonkers!"

2222
02:09:22,041 --> 02:09:25,124
"As luck is favoring me"

2223
02:09:25,500 --> 02:09:27,124
"My mind's gone bonkers!"

2224
02:09:27,208 --> 02:09:28,957
"Completely, utterly bonkers!"

2225
02:09:29,041 --> 02:09:30,582
"Ohh yeah... ohh yeah..."

2226
02:09:30,666 --> 02:09:32,790
Jhakkass Nandu!

2227
02:09:36,625 --> 02:09:39,040
See how that moron is dancing?

2228
02:09:39,125 --> 02:09:41,915
He has everything that
should have been yours...

2229
02:10:04,291 --> 02:10:12,291
"I've got a feeling.."

2230
02:10:25,791 --> 02:10:26,791
Hey!

2231
02:10:27,375 --> 02:10:28,999
All of you are scoundrels!

2232
02:10:29,041 --> 02:10:30,040
Roaming around the whole day,

2233
02:10:30,125 --> 02:10:32,365
and I can't even go to the loo
without being in disguise.

2234
02:10:32,875 --> 02:10:36,665
Mohini is so much better
than you guys! She set me free!

2235
02:10:37,875 --> 02:10:39,624
Haa, Mohini!

2236
02:10:39,666 --> 02:10:41,415
What a sweet girl!

2237
02:10:41,458 --> 02:10:43,665
Charlie, I was thinking that...

2238
02:10:43,750 --> 02:10:46,040
we should tell her the truth.

2239
02:10:46,916 --> 02:10:49,415
Tammy, are you drunk?

2240
02:10:51,500 --> 02:10:52,540
Charlie..

2241
02:10:52,583 --> 02:10:54,165
Me and Tammy have decided,

2242
02:10:54,250 --> 02:10:57,040
why not include Mohini
in our plan too?

2243
02:10:57,250 --> 02:11:01,790
Oh wow, you guys have decided to
tell Mohini our plan.

2244
02:11:01,833 --> 02:11:03,313
Has anyone
thought of the consequence?

2245
02:11:03,416 --> 02:11:05,540
She will go tell
the cops everything...

2246
02:11:05,791 --> 02:11:08,915
Of course this is a Mohini Fan Club.

2247
02:11:09,041 --> 02:11:11,415
Hmm pray tell me, how
will you tell her?

2248
02:11:11,500 --> 02:11:12,915
Say it frankly, don't be scared.

2249
02:11:13,041 --> 02:11:15,790
Yes I think I'll go tell her.

2250
02:11:16,166 --> 02:11:18,499
Hi Mohini, I am Charlie the thief!

2251
02:11:18,541 --> 02:11:20,665
The Mastermind! Hmm..

2252
02:11:21,916 --> 02:11:23,415
I have made this plan.

2253
02:11:23,666 --> 02:11:25,540
I mean who'd imagine...

2254
02:11:25,916 --> 02:11:29,040
That 5 losers are here,
not to dance in the competition..

2255
02:11:29,125 --> 02:11:31,040
But to steal millions
worth of diamonds!

2256
02:11:31,166 --> 02:11:33,499
Mission Happy New Year!

2257
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:38,915
And if your small, naive heart
breaks because of us...

2258
02:11:39,041 --> 02:11:43,540
so you know what, we are big fans,
don't tell the police..

2259
02:11:43,666 --> 02:11:46,540
You know we are very, very sorry!

2260
02:11:48,041 --> 02:11:49,874
We are so...!

2261
02:11:53,333 --> 02:11:54,540
Shite!

2262
02:12:02,750 --> 02:12:07,415
You don't look around before you
start talking do you?

2263
02:12:10,083 --> 02:12:10,665
Mohini!

2264
02:12:10,750 --> 02:12:13,165
You heard what we are doing here..

2265
02:12:13,416 --> 02:12:15,499
You don't want to know why we
are doing it?

2266
02:12:15,541 --> 02:12:17,249
Please, please give me a chance.

2267
02:12:18,500 --> 02:12:24,290
And then I told Mohini
dad's entire story.

2268
02:12:25,375 --> 02:12:28,624
Tammy, Jag and their friendship,

2269
02:12:29,083 --> 02:12:31,665
And Charan Grover & their enmity.

2270
02:12:32,791 --> 02:12:35,165
I lost everything in one day..

2271
02:12:35,625 --> 02:12:39,749
And learnt that fate
is a fickle mistress,

2272
02:12:40,916 --> 02:12:42,874
It can change sides anytime!

2273
02:12:43,666 --> 02:12:46,290
And on that day,

2274
02:12:46,708 --> 02:12:48,915
I decided to ruin Charan Grover.

2275
02:12:49,416 --> 02:12:54,915
What will you tell your father once
you too are in Jail?

2276
02:12:57,250 --> 02:12:59,790
You think he'll be proud of you?

2277
02:13:03,958 --> 02:13:05,165
Dad's not in jail.

2278
02:13:05,416 --> 02:13:07,165
Manohar's not in jail?

2279
02:13:07,708 --> 02:13:09,040
Where is he?

2280
02:13:09,791 --> 02:13:11,915
Dad had appealed
in the Supreme court.

2281
02:13:12,291 --> 02:13:13,415
However,

2282
02:13:13,791 --> 02:13:16,499
Grover had bought over
dad's lawyers..

2283
02:13:17,416 --> 02:13:19,540
Tampered with the evidence..

2284
02:13:20,708 --> 02:13:22,665
And dad lost the case.

2285
02:13:23,250 --> 02:13:24,540
They say...

2286
02:13:24,916 --> 02:13:27,915
a man can survive
for 4 weeks without food,

2287
02:13:28,125 --> 02:13:29,874
4 days without water..

2288
02:13:29,916 --> 02:13:32,374
Maybe 4 minutes without air..

2289
02:13:34,625 --> 02:13:37,165
But without hope?

2290
02:13:38,375 --> 02:13:41,249
Even 4 seconds is impossible.

2291
02:13:42,541 --> 02:13:45,040
Dad showed a lot of courage,
Tammy!

2292
02:13:45,416 --> 02:13:46,790
24 hours later..

2293
02:13:47,166 --> 02:13:50,165
They found his body.

2294
02:13:51,125 --> 02:13:54,499
He found a piece of
blade, and he cut himself Tammy.

2295
02:13:58,625 --> 02:14:00,915
Charlie, Charlie, Charlie...

2296
02:14:05,916 --> 02:14:06,916
Charlie,

2297
02:14:07,166 --> 02:14:09,624
Manohar is dead
and you are telling us today?

2298
02:14:10,583 --> 02:14:13,415
I wanted to tell you but I thought
it will make you weak.

2299
02:14:14,083 --> 02:14:16,665
We still had to destroy Charan Grover.

2300
02:14:17,041 --> 02:14:19,749
And for revenge you need motivation.

2301
02:14:21,041 --> 02:14:22,415
No motivation,

2302
02:14:22,583 --> 02:14:24,290
No crime. Right, Tammy?

2303
02:14:24,375 --> 02:14:26,290
You Idiot my motivation
has doubled now!

2304
02:14:26,416 --> 02:14:27,290
Yes!

2305
02:14:27,375 --> 02:14:28,665
Grover, Grover, Grover..

2306
02:14:28,750 --> 02:14:30,540
No one can save him now!

2307
02:14:30,666 --> 02:14:33,790
I'm going to kill him, Charlie!
I want to...

2308
02:14:33,916 --> 02:14:34,999
No.. no.. no.. jag.

2309
02:14:35,041 --> 02:14:37,040
Killing him is not a solution.

2310
02:14:37,375 --> 02:14:40,790
If he dies, he won't know
how much dad had suffered.

2311
02:14:41,375 --> 02:14:43,665
He has to die everyday, here...

2312
02:14:44,291 --> 02:14:45,415
in Dubai Jail.

2313
02:14:46,500 --> 02:14:48,165
The law here is extremely strict.

2314
02:14:48,625 --> 02:14:51,290
They cut off your hands for the
smallest of robberies..

2315
02:14:51,625 --> 02:14:54,915
Imagine what they
will do to Grover...

2316
02:14:55,125 --> 02:14:57,665
if he is caught for
stealing these diamonds?

2317
02:14:58,041 --> 02:15:00,415
They will cut his limbs..

2318
02:15:00,666 --> 02:15:02,040
And still keep him alive.

2319
02:15:02,541 --> 02:15:04,415
That will be his punishment,
and that..

2320
02:15:04,875 --> 02:15:06,124
That will be justice.

2321
02:15:06,541 --> 02:15:09,665
Super plan, Charlie!
That a super plan.

2322
02:15:10,958 --> 02:15:13,249
This isn't just a robbery for me...

2323
02:15:14,875 --> 02:15:16,790
it's like a memorial
service for my father!

2324
02:15:16,916 --> 02:15:18,665
Which I have denied
myself for 8 years.

2325
02:15:18,916 --> 02:15:21,915
If he himself tries to stop me, I...

2326
02:15:22,125 --> 02:15:23,915
I still won't budge!

2327
02:15:24,500 --> 02:15:25,874
I'm going to do this...

2328
02:15:26,041 --> 02:15:28,790
And if you guys don't
want to come along, its okay,

2329
02:15:28,916 --> 02:15:30,165
I will do this alone.

2330
02:15:30,416 --> 02:15:32,165
You idiot!

2331
02:15:33,250 --> 02:15:35,499
We've all been alone
since 8 years!

2332
02:15:35,541 --> 02:15:37,915
You got us together for this...

2333
02:15:38,916 --> 02:15:40,249
And now you're talking
About being alone again!

2334
02:15:40,375 --> 02:15:41,040

There is a strange
man vomiting in our room!

2358
02:17:43,541 --> 02:17:44,665
It's disgusting.

2359

Hello, hello, Mohini come in.
Hello, Can you hear me?

2366
02:18:14,500 --> 02:18:17,040
You remember right? You have to get
Vikki till the lift?

2367
02:18:17,166 --> 02:18:20,290
Lift? I will drag him till hell
if I have to!

2368
02:18:23,125 --> 02:18:24,415
Vikki!

2369
02:18:27,125 --> 02:18:28,624
Please help me Vikki!

2370
02:18:29,041 --> 02:18:30,415
I can't find my room.

2371
02:18:30,791 --> 02:18:32,540
I have to change my clothes,

2372
02:18:32,666 --> 02:18:37,540

change in front of you...

2373
02:18:38,375 --> 02:18:40,874
You'll come, won't you Vikki?

2374
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:43,790
Ahh... Not Vikki.

Mohini! You have to go
in the lift on your right.

2379
02:18:59,375 --> 02:19:00,540
Vikki...

2380
02:19:01,541 --> 02:19:03,165
It's so hot here?

2381
02:19:03,291 --> 02:19:06,374
I feel like taking
my clothes off here...

2382
02:19:06,416 --> 02:19:08,290
and throwing them away!

2383
02:19:09,458 --> 02:19:10,540
Rohan, what's going on?

2384
02:19:10,625 --> 02:19:12,540
Charlie, Mohini is going to strip!

2385
02:19:12,666 --> 02:19:15,415
Shut up. Keep the walkie down and
get back to work.

2386
02:19:16,541 --> 02:19:17,541
Mohini won't strip.

2387
02:19:17,666 --> 02:19:18,790
Naah!

2388
02:19:18,916 --> 02:19:20,165

killer Dejavu...

2393
02:19:36,750 --> 02:19:37,750
Huh?

2394
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:41,624
You know Dejavu? When you feel
like all this has happened before?

2395
02:19:42,125 --> 02:19:45,124
When did it happen? We tried but it
didn't happen!

2396
02:19:45,416 --> 02:19:46,416
Huh?!

2397
02:19:47,041 --> 02:19:48,124
Time to sleep!

2398
02:19:49,375 --> 02:19:51,165
Good. He won't remember a thing now.

2399
02:19:51,416 --> 02:19:53,915
Good Jag, take Vikki Grover to his
suite and keep him there...

2400
02:19:54,125 --> 02:19:57,374
And yes, get Nandu changed and
send Mohini to room 9C. Over and out!

2401
02:19:57,416 --> 02:19:59,415
Piece of cake my ass!

02:20:00,458 --> 02:20:01,165
Come.. come.. come Rohan.

2403
02:20:01,333 --> 02:20:02,874

Come in, Charlie.

2407
02:20:34,625 --> 02:20:35,499
Go for Charlie!

2408
02:20:35,541 --> 02:20:36,790
Nandu's left from there.

2409
02:20:52,041 --> 02:20:54,290
Everything is under control..

2410
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:56,624
Jag! Jag!

2411
02:20:57,250 --> 02:20:59,040
Save me! I can't do this...

2412
02:20:59,125 --> 02:21:00,957
Grover's commando's will kill me!

2413
02:21:01,041 --> 02:21:02,415
Hello, Charlie! Come in!

2414
02:21:02,791 --> 02:21:04,540

2415
02:21:05,666 --> 02:21:07,040
Focus!

2416
02:21:07,916 --> 02:21:09,124
Meaning?

2417
02:21:09,291 --> 02:21:11,415
Jag! Give the walkie to Nandu!

2418
02:21:14,416 --> 02:21:16,415

02:21:16,625 --> 02:21:18,540

2422
02:21:24,041 --> 02:21:26,374

This is it, Tammy.
150 feet away...

2437
02:23:07,291 --> 02:23:08,291
Shalimar.

2438
02:23:10,166 --> 02:23:11,166
Are you ready?

2439
02:23:12,791 --> 02:23:14,040

2441
02:23:17,041 --> 02:23:17,790
Yes!

2442
02:23:17,916 --> 02:23:19,540
There was a dialogue in it...

2443
02:23:19,666 --> 02:23:20,999
I am the king of the world?

2444
02:23:21,125 --> 02:23:22,415
No not that one.

2445
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:25,040
You jump...

2446
02:23:25,250 --> 02:23:26,250
I jump.

2447
02:23:29,375 --> 02:23:30,790
Charlie...

2448
02:23:30,916 --> 02:23:35,540

2454
02:23:44,416 --> 02:23:45,416

2455
02:23:45,500 --> 02:23:46,665
Rubbish we're fine?!

2456
02:23:46,791 --> 02:23:48,499
My back side's scrapped!
Ssshhhhh!!

2457
02:23:48,541 --> 02:23:50,290
Okay.. okay.. okay! Nandu is in.

2458
02:23:50,416 --> 02:23:53,415
Video loop is on.
Now Shalimar security will see...

2459
02:23:53,458 --> 02:23:55,499
only what we show them.

2460
02:23:56,166 --> 02:23:57,540
Which is nothing!

2461
02:24:00,875 --> 02:24:01,540
1...

2462
02:24:01,666 --> 02:24:02,666
2...

2463
02:24:04,916 --> 02:24:06,124
Looks like Nandu's reached.

2464
02:24:38,250 --> 02:24:39,665
Oh my God!

2465
02:24:39,916 --> 02:24:41,165
Unbelievable.

2466
02:24:41,291 --> 02:24:42,291
What?

2467
02:24:42,500 --> 02:24:43,540
All okay?

2468
02:24:43,791 --> 02:24:46,374
Nandu Bhide.. is the man.

2469
02:24:49,541 --> 02:24:50,541
See this...

2470
02:24:52,166 --> 02:24:54,874
Nandu Bhide.. is the man.

2471
02:24:59,041 --> 02:25:00,499
Charlie he is...

2472
02:25:00,625 --> 02:25:01,625
He is what?

2473
02:25:01,791 --> 02:25:04,040
What.. what? Will someone tell us
what's happening.

2474
02:25:04,125 --> 02:25:06,415
Shhh... Rohan tell me
what Nandu is doing?

2475
02:25:06,500 --> 02:25:07,290
We're losing time here.

2476
02:25:07,375 --> 02:25:09,124
Nandu is opening... it...

2477
02:25:15,125 --> 02:25:16,290
Oh Goddess!!

2478
02:25:22,916 --> 02:25:24,415
Let's go, Tammy. Lights off!

2479
02:25:24,541 --> 02:25:25,541
Yeah!

2480
02:25:36,041 --> 02:25:37,624
Why are you naked?

2481
02:25:40,458 --> 02:25:41,458
Tammy!

2482
02:25:42,541 --> 02:25:46,040
Nandu, wear your shorts,
shut the panel, and leave,

2483
02:25:47,291 --> 02:25:49,999
Rohan...
disable the laser-shield!

2484
02:25:50,375 --> 02:25:51,540
Let's go!

2485
02:25:51,625 --> 02:25:52,625
Why is he naked?

2486
02:25:52,666 --> 02:25:54,290
It's his personal choice...

2487
02:26:08,375 --> 02:26:11,165
Tehmy... Jag get ready for time-sync.

2488
02:26:11,958 --> 02:26:13,249
Hairspray, Tammy?

2489
02:26:16,666 --> 02:26:18,415
Rohan! Laser-shield's are still up!

2490
02:26:18,541 --> 02:26:19,915
Just a minute, Charlie Just a minute!
Just a minute.

2491
02:26:20,041 --> 02:26:21,540
We don't have a minute! Do it now!!

2492
02:26:23,916 --> 02:26:26,040
3, 2, 1!

2493

2495
02:26:35,416 --> 02:26:36,665
Starts now.

2496
02:26:36,791 --> 02:26:39,374
Jag, switch the water
pipes with the oxygen pipes.

2497
02:27:24,916 --> 02:27:26,415
- Tammy! Tammy!
- It's me.

2498
02:27:27,791 --> 02:27:28,791
Tammy!

2499
02:27:28,875 --> 02:27:30,874

Oh God!

2502
02:27:35,541 --> 02:27:37,141
Hold him down, Charlie.
He'll be alright.

2503
02:27:37,250 --> 02:27:38,540
I know he'll be alright.

2504
02:27:38,666 --> 02:27:40,040
Common Tammy!

2505
02:27:40,916 --> 02:27:43,499
Oh God! Not now! Not now!

2506
02:27:44,041 --> 02:27:45,041
Tammy!

2507
02:27:45,541 --> 02:27:47,040
How much time Charlie?

2508
02:27:47,541 --> 02:27:48,541
3 minutes left, Tammy.

2509
02:27:48,625 --> 02:27:49,625
Sorry.

2510
02:27:49,666 --> 02:27:50,540
Common Charlie...

2511
02:27:50,666 --> 02:27:52,165
I got a safe to crack!

2512
02:28:32,041 --> 02:28:33,290
I did it! I did it!

2513
02:28:33,375 --> 02:28:35,040
Well done, Tammy!!

2514
02:28:35,541 --> 02:28:37,290
Yes!

2515
02:28:38,541 --> 02:28:39,621
And we have 2 minutes left.

2516
02:28:39,625 --> 02:28:41,249
I am a genius. I am a genius.

2517
02:28:41,291 --> 02:28:42,540
Tammy, will you marry me?

2518
02:28:42,625 --> 02:28:43,625
Anytime.

2519
02:29:01,916 --> 02:29:03,040
Let's go.

2520
02:29:08,416 --> 02:29:09,790
What's this, Charlie?

2521
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:11,040
What now?

2522
02:29:12,291 --> 02:29:13,790
There's another safe here...

2523
02:29:13,916 --> 02:29:15,040
A Glass one.

2524
02:29:15,416 --> 02:29:17,665
Most probably re-enforced
glass or rayon thermoplastic.

2525
02:29:17,750 --> 02:29:19,665
Alpha coded.

2526
02:29:20,041 --> 02:29:21,624
7 digits password...

2527
02:29:21,875 --> 02:29:23,499
Why you wasting time, Charlie!

2528
02:29:23,541 --> 02:29:25,415
If it's a glass safe,
Break it and take the diamonds!

2529
02:29:25,500 --> 02:29:26,790
Shut up, Nandu!

2530
02:29:27,041 --> 02:29:28,915
This opens with a 7 letter password...

2531
02:29:29,041 --> 02:29:30,415
If we put in the wrong password,
the alarm will go off.

2532
02:29:30,500 --> 02:29:31,580
Dammit... dammit... dammit.

2533
02:29:31,625 --> 02:29:32,625
Dammit!

2534
02:29:33,041 --> 02:29:35,249
I underestimated Grover.

2535
02:29:36,041 --> 02:29:38,040
I don't know anything about this safe.

2536
02:29:38,500 --> 02:29:40,165
But I do.

2537
02:29:40,375 --> 02:29:42,374
Charlie this is Manohar's safe too.

2538
02:29:42,416 --> 02:29:43,290
Dad's?

2539
02:29:43,416 --> 02:29:45,165
It has Manohar's mark on it.

2540
02:29:45,375 --> 02:29:46,665
Tammy! Tammy! Tammy!

2541
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:48,320
Manohar's bulletproof Glass safe?

2542
02:29:48,375 --> 02:29:49,249
Yes, yes that one!

2543
02:29:49,291 --> 02:29:51,040
Jag, Jag,
Jag, any password or master code?

2544
02:29:51,166 --> 02:29:52,366
Tell me Quick.. quick.. quick.

2545
02:29:52,416 --> 02:29:53,540
Password?

2546
02:29:54,166 --> 02:29:56,665
Manohar never told us the password.

2547
02:29:56,875 --> 02:29:59,790
Whenever we asked him about it,
He would say...

2548
02:29:59,916 --> 02:30:01,790
Only Charlie can open this!

2549
02:30:03,666 --> 02:30:05,540
He told you anything?

2550
02:30:05,666 --> 02:30:07,415
I am seeing this
safe for the 1st time.

2551
02:30:07,666 --> 02:30:08,790
Okay...

2552
02:30:09,541 --> 02:30:11,374
Charlie you need
to move out right now.

2553
02:30:11,416 --> 02:30:13,040
You've got one minute
Charlie then the safe will shut!

2554
02:30:13,166 --> 02:30:14,806
I don't know,
I've never seen this before.

2555
02:30:15,041 --> 02:30:16,124
Charlie... Charlie... Charlie!!

2556
02:30:16,166 --> 02:30:17,540
Charlie please get out of there...

2557
02:30:17,666 --> 02:30:19,415
Come on Charlie... Charlie!!

2558
02:30:19,500 --> 02:30:20,915
Only Charlie can open it...

2559
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:22,000
Common!

2560
02:30:22,041 --> 02:30:23,790
Charlie let's go please.

2561
02:30:23,875 --> 02:30:25,790
Come on, Charlie, think, Charlie!

2562
02:30:25,875 --> 02:30:27,540
Hurry up!

2563
02:30:27,791 --> 02:30:29,040
Quiet guys... quiet... quiet.. quiet!

2564
02:30:29,166 --> 02:30:30,540
One sec I know... I know!

2565
02:30:30,916 --> 02:30:33,374
Let it go,
Charlie, forget it, Charlie.

2566
02:30:33,416 --> 02:30:35,790
Dad... dad... dad...
help me here...

2567
02:30:36,041 --> 02:30:37,290
7 digit code...

2568
02:30:37,500 --> 02:30:39,374
Only Charlie can open it...
What does it mean?

2569
02:30:39,416 --> 02:30:40,499
Come on, Charlie

2570
02:30:40,541 --> 02:30:42,040
Sshhh!!!

2571
02:30:46,791 --> 02:30:50,290
Only Charlie can open this safe.

2572
02:30:50,750 --> 02:30:53,040
Yeah.

2573
02:30:59,041 --> 02:31:01,374
Only Charlie can open it.

2574
02:31:01,875 --> 02:31:03,040
Guys I'm going for it.

2575
02:31:09,041 --> 02:31:10,041
C...

2576
02:31:13,666 --> 02:31:14,915
H...

2577
02:31:16,416 --> 02:31:17,416
A...

2578
02:31:19,250 --> 02:31:20,290
R...

2579
02:31:22,166 --> 02:31:23,415
L...

2580
02:31:24,791 --> 02:31:26,290
I...

2581
02:31:27,875 --> 02:31:29,790
Only Charlie can open it...

2582
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:33,040
E!

2583
02:31:52,791 --> 02:31:54,249
Charlie!

2584
02:31:55,291 --> 02:31:57,165
Dad always said...

2585
02:31:59,041 --> 02:32:00,665
keep it simple!

2586
02:32:05,666 --> 02:32:07,415
We did it Tammy.

2587
02:32:21,791 --> 02:32:23,040
Grover!

2588
02:32:23,916 --> 02:32:26,124
You are finished!

2589
02:32:32,625 --> 02:32:34,915
Rohan, Vikki Grover's woken up!

2590
02:32:35,041 --> 02:32:35,665
Damn...

2591
02:32:35,791 --> 02:32:36,791
How did he wake up?

2592
02:32:36,916 --> 02:32:38,624
Okay... okay... okay... Plan B.

2593
02:32:38,791 --> 02:32:40,290
Everybody initiate... PLAN B.

2594
02:32:40,375 --> 02:32:41,540
Guys, Plan B!

2595
02:32:41,625 --> 02:32:42,625
Let's go, guys!

2596
02:32:44,250 --> 02:32:47,124
Listen I'm off to the Jetty,
explain Plan B to her.

2597
02:32:47,541 --> 02:32:48,915
- Nandu?
- Mohini!

2598
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:50,040
Rohan?

2599
02:32:50,291 --> 02:32:51,874
We lied to you.

2600
02:32:51,916 --> 02:32:52,665
I know Rohan...

2601
02:32:52,791 --> 02:32:54,124
We lied again yesterday...

2602
02:32:54,166 --> 02:32:56,415
What we told you was just plan A.

2603
02:32:57,125 --> 02:32:58,624
Whenever I initiate plan B,

2604
02:32:58,666 --> 02:33:03,124
Everyone will come here
to this jetty immediately.

2605
02:33:04,166 --> 02:33:07,540
In 15 minutes, we will
leave in this yellow flag boat...

2606
02:33:07,791 --> 02:33:09,915
and we will be in
international waters soon...

2607
02:33:10,166 --> 02:33:13,290
Away from their police and
the law. Safe and sound.

2608
02:33:13,541 --> 02:33:16,290
But Charlie, won't the cops get
Suspicious if we disappear?

2609
02:33:17,416 --> 02:33:19,915
They will suspect Vikki Grover.

2610
02:33:20,833 --> 02:33:23,290
They will find his
fingerprints at Shalimar,

2611
02:33:23,500 --> 02:33:26,874
and the commando's will re-confirm
that Vikki Grover had come.

2612
02:33:27,250 --> 02:33:28,250
Right!

2613
02:33:28,791 --> 02:33:30,499
Yeah sure.

2614
02:33:30,791 --> 02:33:32,124
Oh, yeah.

2615
02:33:34,875 --> 02:33:35,875
Excuse me.

2616
02:33:36,791 --> 02:33:38,540
Charlie hurry hurry fast fast!

2617
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:41,124
Yeah, come on.

2618
02:33:41,291 --> 02:33:43,540
Charlie, the door is shutting,
Charlie, the door is shutting,

2619
02:33:43,625 --> 02:33:44,745
Charlie, how will we go out?

2620
02:33:44,791 --> 02:33:47,290
Breathe... breathe!!
Charlie, how will we go out?

2621
02:33:47,500 --> 02:33:48,124
Breathe... breathe!!

2622
02:33:48,166 --> 02:33:50,540
Damn you tell me
how are we getting out?

2623
02:33:50,666 --> 02:33:51,666
Shhh... shhh!

2624
02:33:53,791 --> 02:33:54,915
Yeah?

2625
02:33:55,500 --> 02:33:56,500
See...

2626
02:34:06,291 --> 02:34:08,040
We are flying out?

2627
02:34:08,166 --> 02:34:09,166
Nope.

2628
02:34:09,625 --> 02:34:11,040
Swim out!

2629
02:34:11,541 --> 02:34:12,541
Jag...

2630
02:34:12,666 --> 02:34:13,415
do it!

2631
02:34:13,500 --> 02:34:14,624
Yes, Charlie.

2632
02:34:32,416 --> 02:34:34,124
Charlie, water.. Charlie, water!

2633
02:34:34,166 --> 02:34:35,790
Water... water...

2634
02:34:35,875 --> 02:34:38,290
You didn't tell me about
the damn water!

2635
02:34:38,666 --> 02:34:41,040
Jag ya... Good rate, the water is
coming in at a good rate. Very good.

2636
02:34:41,250 --> 02:34:42,624
Keep the oxygen pipes ready..

2637
02:34:42,916 --> 02:34:44,040
We are good to go.

2638
02:34:44,125 --> 02:34:44,874
What are you doing?

2639
02:34:44,916 --> 02:34:48,499
I have to make do with what I have,
It's a floatation device!

2640
02:34:53,541 --> 02:34:55,374
What's going on? It all looks fine.

2641
02:34:58,500 --> 02:34:59,790
What the hell!

2642
02:35:00,166 --> 02:35:01,540
It's a loop!

2643
02:35:02,416 --> 02:35:04,040
It's a video loop.

2644
02:35:04,875 --> 02:35:06,540
The water's rising, Charlie!

2645
02:35:06,625 --> 02:35:07,915
Tammy don't worry.

2646
02:35:08,041 --> 02:35:09,915
It's rising... It's rising!

2647
02:35:17,875 --> 02:35:18,999
Mr. Kapoor...

2648
02:35:19,041 --> 02:35:20,540
Shalimar right now!

2649
02:35:21,166 --> 02:35:23,499
We are going to drown, Charlie!

2650
02:35:36,291 --> 02:35:37,291
Okay Tammy...

2651
02:35:37,875 --> 02:35:38,875
Hold your breath...

2652
02:35:38,916 --> 02:35:39,916
Now!

2653
02:35:58,250 --> 02:35:59,915
Jag change the pipe.

2654
02:36:00,250 --> 02:36:02,040
Let's go guys... Common fast!

2655
02:36:02,791 --> 02:36:04,040
Tammy okay?

2656
02:36:04,666 --> 02:36:06,499
Sir I've checked all the systems
Everything seems..

2657
02:36:06,541 --> 02:36:07,624
Something's wrong!

2658
02:36:07,916 --> 02:36:09,374
Charlie, got it?

2659
02:36:15,125 --> 02:36:16,915
Okay guys we are done here!

2660
02:36:19,541 --> 02:36:21,790
There is a breach of security...
How is it possible?

2661
02:36:39,125 --> 02:36:40,915
Vikky Grover... Access Granted.

2662
02:37:09,250 --> 02:37:10,290
Grover?

2663
02:37:10,916 --> 02:37:12,415
Where are our diamonds?

2664
02:37:12,875 --> 02:37:14,415
It's impossible.

2665
02:37:15,416 --> 02:37:17,415
I think it's... it's a setup man!

2666
02:37:17,500 --> 02:37:19,415
And a very clever one at that!

2667
02:37:19,500 --> 02:37:21,790
Only you and your
son can enter this place.

2668
02:37:21,916 --> 02:37:23,624
You told us so yourself!

2669
02:37:35,125 --> 02:37:38,124
What's behind this?

2670
02:37:38,166 --> 02:37:40,040
Sir, some old A/C ducts..

2671
02:37:40,250 --> 02:37:42,040
But these are shut since years!

2672
02:37:42,166 --> 02:37:43,499
Open it.

2673
02:37:44,166 --> 02:37:45,499
Open it!

2674
02:37:48,041 --> 02:37:52,290
Where does this duct go?

2675
02:37:52,875 --> 02:37:54,790
I was really scared, Charlie!

2676
02:37:54,875 --> 02:37:56,540
I thought you guys
won't turn up at all!

2677
02:37:56,666 --> 02:37:58,415
I was going to leave alone!

2678
02:37:58,625 --> 02:38:00,249
Hey Rohan's here.

2679
02:38:03,750 --> 02:38:05,290
Rohan, why have you come alone?

2680
02:38:05,625 --> 02:38:06,665
Where's Mohini?

2681
02:38:07,416 --> 02:38:08,416
Where is Mohini?

2682
02:38:34,250 --> 02:38:39,165
My mom used to say, the most
important thing in life, is respect.

2683
02:38:41,625 --> 02:38:43,874
Mohini! Let's leave
before it gets too late!

2684
02:38:43,916 --> 02:38:45,165
You go Rohan, I am not coming.

2685
02:38:45,375 --> 02:38:47,374
Mohini, Are you freaking nuts!

2686
02:38:47,708 --> 02:38:49,249
Mohini, please don't do this.

2687
02:38:49,291 --> 02:38:52,124
You'll get caught if you back out now.

2688
02:38:52,250 --> 02:38:54,165
Mohini, it's too late...

2689
02:38:55,083 --> 02:38:56,790
It is too late, Rohan!

2690
02:38:57,833 --> 02:39:00,415
The whole world is
rooting for India today..

2691
02:39:01,041 --> 02:39:02,999
And India has put their faith in us.

2692
02:39:03,625 --> 02:39:08,040
India will lose its face
& respect If we don't dance today.

2693
02:39:09,375 --> 02:39:13,415
And If you lose you lose,
but don't lose respect!

2694
02:39:15,416 --> 02:39:16,832
- You go, Rohan.
- Mohini?!

2695
02:39:16,916 --> 02:39:18,082
Go!

2696
02:39:25,958 --> 02:39:27,665
Great! One less Share.

2697
02:39:27,916 --> 02:39:29,165
Let's leave..

2698
02:39:29,791 --> 02:39:30,874
Let's go.

2699
02:39:31,416 --> 02:39:32,624
Not one..

2700
02:39:33,625 --> 02:39:34,625
Two.

2701
02:39:36,250 --> 02:39:39,499
Charlie, I just came here
to tell you guys that...

2702
02:39:39,666 --> 02:39:42,165
both me and Mohini
won't be coming.

2703
02:39:44,416 --> 02:39:46,249
All the best to you, guys.

2704
02:39:46,416 --> 02:39:47,749
I am sorry.

2705
02:39:52,500 --> 02:39:54,665
Not two...

2706
02:39:55,625 --> 02:39:57,040
three.

2707
02:39:57,541 --> 02:39:59,165
Wait Rohan. I'm coming too.

2708
02:39:59,541 --> 02:40:00,624
Hey..

2709
02:40:00,875 --> 02:40:02,415
Have you lost it?

2710
02:40:02,500 --> 02:40:05,124
You keep changing
the plan all the time!

2711
02:40:05,166 --> 02:40:06,166
Have you gone mad?

2712
02:40:06,291 --> 02:40:07,665
You are Mad!

2713
02:40:08,041 --> 02:40:10,749
You will never improve
you drunken wastrel!

2714
02:40:10,791 --> 02:40:11,665
Shut up!

2715
02:40:11,791 --> 02:40:13,040
He's all yours.

2716
02:40:13,166 --> 02:40:15,915
Hey why you getting
irritated at him. Relax.

2717
02:40:16,041 --> 02:40:17,041
Relax?

2718
02:40:17,125 --> 02:40:18,915
Charlie, relax?

2719
02:40:19,791 --> 02:40:22,040
What sort of people are you?

2720
02:40:22,250 --> 02:40:26,540
That poor girl is risking her life
to fight for our respect..

2721
02:40:26,625 --> 02:40:28,874
For India's respect..

2722
02:40:29,041 --> 02:40:30,374
And we will just leave
her and go?

2723
02:40:30,416 --> 02:40:31,749
You have lost the plot.

2724
02:40:31,791 --> 02:40:33,665
If we go back then
everyone gets arrested!

2725
02:40:33,791 --> 02:40:35,124
Stick to the plan!

2726
02:40:35,166 --> 02:40:38,040
Take your bloody plan,
make a trumpet out of it...

2727
02:40:38,125 --> 02:40:39,165
and shove it up your...

2728
02:40:39,166 --> 02:40:40,540
muscular bum!

2729
02:40:40,625 --> 02:40:42,124
- Tammy!
- Hey don't touch me.

2730
02:40:42,166 --> 02:40:44,165
Tammy - It's my decision.

2731
02:40:44,291 --> 02:40:45,291
What are you doing!

2732
02:40:45,375 --> 02:40:45,915
Hey!

2733
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:47,165
My decision!

2734
02:40:48,583 --> 02:40:50,415
This is wrong, we are a team guys.

2735
02:40:50,541 --> 02:40:52,790
This is wrong!

2736
02:40:52,958 --> 02:40:56,165
We have got one chance to do
something right in our lives!

2737
02:40:56,250 --> 02:40:57,290
No, Tammy!

2738
02:40:57,375 --> 02:40:58,874
What are you two doing?!

2739
02:40:59,125 --> 02:41:00,499
Stop.

2740
02:41:00,666 --> 02:41:03,415
You are sick.

2741
02:41:08,875 --> 02:41:09,915
Okay, get in here.

2742
02:41:10,041 --> 02:41:11,321
This room belongs to which team?

2743
02:41:12,041 --> 02:41:13,165
Which team?

2744
02:41:13,375 --> 02:41:14,665
Sir last minute,

2745
02:41:14,750 --> 02:41:16,040
Team India!

2746
02:41:16,166 --> 02:41:17,040
This is the one. This is the one.

2747
02:41:17,166 --> 02:41:18,624
Move this, move this.

2748
02:41:18,791 --> 02:41:20,665
Marco... open this panel.

2749
02:41:29,000 --> 02:41:31,040
Rohan put this up properly.

2750
02:41:31,166 --> 02:41:32,665
Make sure that you
seal the panel completely.

2751
02:41:32,750 --> 02:41:33,915
Are you sure?

2752
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:34,790
Yes, Rohan.

2753
02:41:34,875 --> 02:41:37,499
We will never come back this way.
Never.

2754
02:41:51,958 --> 02:41:52,832
Where is the show director?

2755
02:41:52,916 --> 02:41:57,207
Sir, I need you to find
Team India wherever they are!

2756
02:41:57,750 --> 02:41:59,999
Just 1 last act left in
the grandest dance competition..

2757
02:42:00,083 --> 02:42:02,040
The world has ever seen!

2758
02:42:02,208 --> 02:42:06,165
The last act by a team that came
here with zero expectations.

2759
02:42:06,291 --> 02:42:07,291
Guys!

2760
02:42:07,500 --> 02:42:09,124
Team India is missing!

2761
02:42:09,416 --> 02:42:10,499
Worldwide..

2762
02:42:10,666 --> 02:42:12,040
I just knew it.

2763
02:42:12,750 --> 02:42:14,249
I tell you, in 10 minutes
they will reach the airport...

2764
02:42:14,291 --> 02:42:15,540
with your diamonds.

2765
02:42:15,750 --> 02:42:17,624
This team is...

2766
02:42:17,666 --> 02:42:19,374
India!

2767
02:42:19,916 --> 02:42:22,749
That's right, my favorite team-

2768
02:42:22,916 --> 02:42:23,916
TEAM

2769
02:42:24,041 --> 02:42:26,249
INDIA!!

2770
02:42:59,166 --> 02:43:05,290
"I've got a feeling.."

2771
02:43:15,041 --> 02:43:16,540
Come on, Mohini!

2772
02:43:17,166 --> 02:43:19,290
"I've got a feeling.."

2773
02:43:19,541 --> 02:43:25,749
"A feeling in my heart."

2774
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:27,000
"That you are.."

2775
02:43:27,041 --> 02:43:29,624
"The one in my soul,
in my life, in my dreams.."

2776
02:43:29,666 --> 02:43:31,999
"..from the start."

2777
02:43:33,041 --> 02:43:36,374
"I've got a feeling!"

2778
02:43:36,666 --> 02:43:44,666
"A feeling in my heart"

2779
02:43:45,291 --> 02:43:48,915
"I'll give you my soul,
and my life and we'll never"

2780
02:43:49,041 --> 02:43:51,165
"Be apart."

2781
02:44:02,416 --> 02:44:04,040
This is just the girl!

2782
02:44:04,875 --> 02:44:06,540
Where's the rest of the team?

2783
02:44:06,958 --> 02:44:08,540
Where are the boys?

2784
02:44:29,541 --> 02:44:32,915
"Radhe, Radhe!"

2785
02:44:33,000 --> 02:44:41,000
"Radhe, Radhe!
Hail Lord Krishna!"

2786
02:44:43,625 --> 02:44:45,290
"My mind's gone bonkers!"

2787
02:44:45,416 --> 02:44:47,165
"A little bonkers!"

2788
02:44:47,250 --> 02:44:50,165
"As luck is favoring me"

2789
02:44:50,625 --> 02:44:52,374
"My mind's gone bonkers!"

2790
02:44:52,416 --> 02:44:54,249
"Completely, utterly bonkers!"

2791
02:44:54,291 --> 02:44:57,290
"Ohh yeah... yeah... yeah"

2792
02:44:57,416 --> 02:44:59,290
"My mind's gone bonkers!"

2793
02:44:59,375 --> 02:45:01,165
"A little bonkers!"

2794
02:45:01,208 --> 02:45:04,374
"As luck is favoring me"

2795
02:45:04,708 --> 02:45:06,499
"My mind's gone bonkers!"

2796
02:45:06,541 --> 02:45:08,290
"Completely, utterly bonkers!"

2797
02:45:08,416 --> 02:45:11,665
"Ohh yeah... yeah... yeah"

2798
02:45:11,791 --> 02:45:19,791

We want Charlie!

2801
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:06,665
We are from a land,

2802
02:46:07,416 --> 02:46:10,165
With plenty of disruptions,

2803
02:46:10,916 --> 02:46:13,749
With news full of...

2804
02:46:14,041 --> 02:46:16,874
scams and corruption!

2805
02:46:17,583 --> 02:46:20,165
Where the common man suffers...

2806
02:46:20,333 --> 02:46:23,290
from poverty and hunger.

2807
02:46:24,041 --> 02:46:25,832
Yet no matter what,

2808
02:46:25,875 --> 02:46:27,874
Ours is not to question why,

2809
02:46:28,208 --> 02:46:31,749
We'll give our lives
to keep our Flag flying high!

2810
02:46:51,541 --> 02:46:55,040
"We are the captains of our destiny"

2811
02:46:55,166 --> 02:46:58,790
"We know the glory of victory"

2812
02:46:59,041 --> 02:47:02,249
"We are friends to our friends."

2813
02:47:02,291 --> 02:47:05,915
"And defeat to our enemies."

2814
02:47:06,583 --> 02:47:10,040
"Try as you like,
you'll never stop us."

2815
02:47:10,166 --> 02:47:13,415
"We are risen, you'll never top us."

2816
02:47:14,041 --> 02:47:17,040
"When we come together"

2817
02:47:17,166 --> 02:47:21,665
"Fate is just a formality."

2818
02:47:23,125 --> 02:47:25,874
How the hell is it possible?!

2819
02:47:34,458 --> 02:47:39,749
"We don't want anything
from the world."

2820
02:47:40,125 --> 02:47:43,415
"Just a place in everyone's hearts"

2821
02:47:43,541 --> 02:47:45,290
"For friends in need
we're friends indeed"

2822
02:47:45,375 --> 02:47:47,165
"We stand by them with our lives."

2823
02:47:47,208 --> 02:47:50,915
"Call us by our names"

2824
02:47:51,000 --> 02:47:54,624
"Call us by our names, Indiawaale"

2825
02:47:54,666 --> 02:47:58,249
"We can make your hearts sing,
Indiawaale"

2826
02:47:58,291 --> 02:48:02,457
"Winning is just our thing,
Indiawaale."

2827
02:48:02,541 --> 02:48:05,040
"Do what you like, but don't mess..."

2828
02:48:06,208 --> 02:48:09,040
"We'll wrap you around
our fingers..."

2829
02:48:10,041 --> 02:48:12,499
"Do what you like,
but don't mess with..."

2830
02:48:12,583 --> 02:48:15,374
"The Indiawaale."

2831
02:48:16,916 --> 02:48:23,499
"I've got a feeling"

2832
02:48:37,166 --> 02:48:40,374
"Call us by our names,
sing Indiawaale."

2833
02:48:40,458 --> 02:48:44,040
"We can make your hearts sing,

2834
02:48:45,125 --> 02:48:48,540
"We are the captains of our destiny"

2835
02:48:48,958 --> 02:48:52,249
"We know the glory of victory"

2836
02:48:52,791 --> 02:48:55,790
"We are friends to our friends"

2837
02:48:55,916 --> 02:48:59,165
"And defeat to our enemies."

2838
02:49:00,208 --> 02:49:03,415
"Try as you like,
you'll never stop us."

2839
02:49:03,833 --> 02:49:07,124
"We are risen, you'll never top us."

2841
02:49:10,916 --> 02:49:14,999
"Fate is just a formality."

2842
02:49:33,291 --> 02:49:35,665
Get him.

2843
02:49:36,500 --> 02:49:37,999
How dare you?!

2844
02:49:38,291 --> 02:49:39,540
Leave me!

2845
02:49:42,583 --> 02:49:44,790
The Winner of WDC...

2846
02:49:44,916 --> 02:49:46,665
by the Highest margin of votes...

2847
02:49:46,791 --> 02:49:48,624
is Team India!
Did I not tell you..

2848
02:49:48,666 --> 02:49:51,874
That there are
just 2 kinds of people in the world.

2849
02:49:52,166 --> 02:49:53,415
Winners...

2850
02:49:53,666 --> 02:49:55,290
and Losers.

2851
02:50:01,291 --> 02:50:02,540
Our lives today,

2852
02:50:02,625 --> 02:50:04,874
gave us losers
this Saccharine moment,

2853
02:50:05,041 --> 02:50:07,415
where we have won the
hearts of the world...

2854
02:50:07,500 --> 02:50:09,040
and emerged victorious!

2855
02:50:40,625 --> 02:50:42,665
And fate...

2856
02:50:43,041 --> 02:50:45,415
fate is a beautiful thing,

2857
02:50:47,208 --> 02:50:52,165
and if you back your dreams with an iron
resolve, it will change sides for you.

2858
02:51:14,916 --> 02:51:17,749
You had put money on
us losing hadn't you, Grover?

2859
02:51:18,041 --> 02:51:20,124
So how much money did you lose?

2860
02:51:20,458 --> 02:51:21,874
1 million?

2861
02:51:22,125 --> 02:51:23,290
5 million?

2862
02:51:23,625 --> 02:51:24,749
10 million?

2863
02:51:26,375 --> 02:51:27,375
Or...

2864
02:51:27,541 --> 02:51:29,665
50 million dollars?

2865
02:51:33,541 --> 02:51:35,290
Who are you?

2866
02:51:37,041 --> 02:51:38,999
I am Manohar's Son.

2867
02:51:41,375 --> 02:51:42,790
Manohar's son?!

2868
02:51:43,000 --> 02:51:44,040
Yeah.

2869
02:51:45,041 --> 02:51:46,165
Who Manohar?

2870
02:51:46,666 --> 02:51:48,290
It's a really long story.

2871
02:51:49,500 --> 02:51:52,165
Both of you will have
lots of time in jail..

2872
02:51:52,500 --> 02:51:54,790
Ask your father..

2873
02:51:55,541 --> 02:51:57,665
Who his father was.

2874
02:52:44,291 --> 02:52:47,290
Nandu you cannot deposit
this cheque in a bank!

2875
02:52:50,416 --> 02:52:53,540
Anyways the real loot is here..
Be careful, Charlie.

2876
02:52:53,625 --> 02:52:55,040
Coming through!

2877
02:53:03,166 --> 02:53:04,166
Thanks.

2878
02:53:21,041 --> 02:53:22,249
Ice gone...

2879
02:53:22,541 --> 02:53:23,624
Diamonds gone...

2880
02:53:23,666 --> 02:53:24,999
We worked so hard...

2881
02:53:25,083 --> 02:53:26,124
For nothing!

2882
02:53:26,166 --> 02:53:27,665
So what?

2883
02:53:28,041 --> 02:53:30,374
We got a cheque of $ 1 million...

2884
02:53:30,416 --> 02:53:31,790
its not enough?

2885
02:53:31,875 --> 02:53:35,915
The diamonds were worth
50 million in the Grey market!

2886
02:53:36,041 --> 02:53:37,415
What will we do with 1 million?

2887
02:53:37,500 --> 02:53:39,665
We will make a huge safe..

2888
02:53:40,166 --> 02:53:42,290
Which even we can't crack into!

2889
02:53:43,041 --> 02:53:46,040
After all,
these 50 million dollar diamonds...

2890
02:53:46,875 --> 02:53:49,540
can't be in this trophy forever,
can they?

2891
02:53:53,666 --> 02:53:54,666
&^%$**...

2892
02:53:54,916 --> 02:53:56,665
Chuck it, guys!

2893
02:53:59,916 --> 02:54:01,499
It's a setup!

2894
02:54:01,791 --> 02:54:04,290
Where are my Diamonds!

2895
02:54:04,416 --> 02:54:06,040
Where are my Diamonds!!

2896
02:55:19,500 --> 02:55:23,040
"I don't know the ABCD of dance."

2897
02:55:23,166 --> 02:55:26,665
"Still, the world wants me to dance."

2898
02:55:26,875 --> 02:55:30,290
"I have never touched whisky in life."

2899
02:55:30,541 --> 02:55:34,040
"Still everyone says that
I am drunk while dancing."

2900
02:55:34,125 --> 02:55:36,040
"Simple guy when dances zealously.."

2901
02:55:36,166 --> 02:55:39,874
"..people says that.."

2902
02:55:41,791 --> 02:55:43,999
"The guy is drunkard."

2903
02:55:44,625 --> 02:55:47,624
"Drunkard."

2904
02:55:49,000 --> 02:55:51,165
"People says that I am drunkard."

2905
02:55:51,791 --> 02:55:55,290
"Drunkard."

2906
02:55:56,041 --> 02:56:04,041
"Why people call me drunkard?"

2907
02:56:26,791 --> 02:56:30,540
"What I haven't done in 364 days."

2908
02:56:30,625 --> 02:56:33,999
"That I did just
on the day of New Year."

2909
02:56:34,041 --> 02:56:37,749
"What I haven't done in 364 days."

2910
02:56:38,000 --> 02:56:41,249
"That I did just
on the day of New Year."

2911
02:56:41,291 --> 02:56:45,624
"I got little high and danced.
So people said.."

2912
02:56:47,166 --> 02:56:49,374
"Why people call me drunkard?"

2913
02:56:49,958 --> 02:56:53,124
"Drunkard.."

2914
02:56:54,333 --> 02:56:56,540
"Why people call me drunkard?"

2915
02:56:57,166 --> 02:57:00,415
"Drunkard.."

2916
02:57:01,708 --> 02:57:09,040
"Why people call me drunkard?"

2917
02:57:09,916 --> 02:57:11,915
"Someone came in modern pant."

2918
02:57:12,000 --> 02:57:13,665
"Some with expensive scents."

2919
02:57:13,833 --> 02:57:15,499
"Someone came in modern pant."

2920
02:57:15,541 --> 02:57:17,290
"Some with expensive scents."

2921
02:57:17,375 --> 02:57:21,040
"You don't know dance."

2922
02:57:21,125 --> 02:57:28,290
"This six pack man
doesn't know dance."

2923
02:57:28,541 --> 02:57:32,290
"Visit the clubs someday,
there'll be many girls."

2924
02:57:32,416 --> 02:57:35,874
"Daily they spend
on vodka and drinks."

2925
02:57:36,041 --> 02:57:37,874
"No one says anything
to these girls.."

2926
02:57:37,958 --> 02:57:40,999
"But all are after me."

2927
02:57:41,791 --> 02:57:49,791
"Why people call me drunkard?"

2928
02:58:08,916 --> 02:58:11,665
"On one peg I dance like Govinda."

2929
02:58:12,541 --> 02:58:15,290
"On two pegs, I dance like Jitendra."

2930
02:58:16,041 --> 02:58:19,499
"On three pegs,
I became drunkard Bachchan."

2931
02:58:19,666 --> 02:58:23,290
"On four pegs,
I dance like Dharmendra."

2932
02:58:23,500 --> 02:58:26,790
"Dance like Dharmendra."

2933
02:58:26,875 --> 02:58:32,374
"Girls get crazy watching me dance."

2934
02:58:32,541 --> 02:58:40,541
"Why people call me drunkard?"

2935
02:59:09,541 --> 02:59:12,749

"Why people call me drunkard?"

2937
02:59:17,083 --> 02:59:19,415
First runner up is.. Editor.

2938
02:59:19,541 --> 02:59:24,915
"Drunkard."

2939
02:59:25,500 --> 02:59:30,207
And the winner of the World Dance
Championship of Happy New Year is..

2940
02:59:30,291 --> 02:59:32,165
Camera department.

2941
02:59:33,250 --> 02:59:40,790
"Why people call me drunkard?"

2942
02:59:44,458 --> 02:59:46,665
Are my children dancing outside?

1
00:00:33,416 --> 00:00:35,915
One early morning.

2
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,749
Lifting the dark
misty veil of the night.

3
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:46,749
From the pillow of its mountain
peak, the sun rose and saw..

4
00:00:48,416 --> 00:00:50,915
The valley is filled
with the season of love.

5
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:54,999
And the branches of
memories have sprouted..

6
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:58,582
..innumerable
blossoms of past moments.

7
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:02,082
Unspoken, unheard yearnings.

8
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:08,749
Half asleep, half awake.
Rubbing its eyes, it watches.

9
00:01:09,583 --> 00:01:14,332
As it flows in wave after wave..

10
00:01:15,083 --> 00:01:18,749
At once new, also the same.

11
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:26,915
Yes, the very same life which
encompasses love and desire.

12
00:01:28,083 --> 00:01:33,915
Meeting and also parting.
And a sense..

13
00:01:34,833 --> 00:01:38,999
..that time is flowing like a river,
whispering as it flows..

14
00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:43,915
..that the valley is
filled with the season of love.

15
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:46,999
And the branches of
memories have sprouted..

16
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:50,915
..innumerable blossoms
of the past moments.

17
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:01,999


18
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:15,832
"Why is the wind singing today"

19
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,915
"Why is the wind singing?"

20
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:43,915
"Why is the season raining colours?"

21
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:48,915
"My heart wonders what
is going to happen today."

22
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:53,665
"Why is there moonlight in the day?"

23
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:58,582
"Which way is life moving?"

24
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:03,582
"My heart wonders what
these events foretell."

25
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:13,749
"Why is the wind singing today?"

26
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:45,749
"Whose face am l
seeing in every flower?"

27
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:59,915
"Whose face do
l see in every flower?"

28
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:09,749
"Whose unheard voice
is in my ears?"

29
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,582
"Whose are these sounds.."

30
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:19,499
"..vibrating in my dreams?"

31
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:24,665
"My heart wonders
whose arrival is awaited."

32
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:29,082
"Why is the wind singing.."

33
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:34,749
Singing, singing.."

34
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:41,165
'Oh, Allah.'

35
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:58,040
Today, your dream is
coming true, Papa.

36
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:01,415
Today, your daughter
begins her first case.

37
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:06,749
You devoted your entire life
for truth and human rights.

38
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:11,249
Today, l am taking my first
step into the same battlefield.

39
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:17,665
As always, l'm taking your
faith and blessings with me.

40
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:51,165
Karim Khan, do you know
how to cook?

41
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:54,665
No, sir, the wife cooks.

42
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:56,999
Better start learning.

43
00:06:57,833 --> 00:07:00,999
Now, women have started
doing men's jobs. Never know..

44
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:04,915
..when you'll have to
sleep on an empty stomach.

45
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:08,332
Now, may l meet the lndian prisoner?

46
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:15,082
Most certainly. Now, you
haνe the right to, Madam Lawyer.

47
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:17,915
Come, l'll escort you myself.

48
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:22,749
That way l'll get to spend a
little more time with you.

49
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,082
Shall we?

50
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:30,499
Excuse me, madam, but
you're wasting your time.

51
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:35,999
This man is here since 22 years,
but no one's heard him..

52
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:38,582
..utter a single word.

53
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:44,332
We think he is νery happy here,
neνer fights, never complains..

54
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,915
..seems like he doesn't
want to be free at all.

55
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,582
Freedom is every
man's birthright and..

56
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:51,665
..it's my duty to see
that he gets it.

57
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:55,165
You do your duty and
let me do mine.

58
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:04,040
Hey, 786. Look who's
come to meet you.

59
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:09,915
You imbecile, Madam Lawyer
is here, at least greet her.

60
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:13,999
The State of Pakistan has
decided to reopen cases..

61
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:15,832
..of some lndian prisoners.

62
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:20,915
So, find your lost voice
quickly and start babbling.

63
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:23,332
This opportunity won't come again.

64
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,749
What did l tell you?
- Open the cell.

65
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,165
l want to speak to him in private.

66
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:39,582
Well, you've signed the papers,
what do l care?

67
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,665
Karim Khan, keep an eye on her.

68
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:52,999
l've done my duty, now
it's up to you and..

69
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:56,915
..your God.

70
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:17,499
Let's begin with names.

71
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:21,165
l'm Saamiya Siddique and you are..

72
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:29,499
Do you want me to call
you 786 like the others do?

73
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:34,749
Your name can't be so unpleasant
that you prefer a number to it?

74
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:42,499
Veer Pratap Singh.

75
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:50,165
lt's ages since you've
heard your name, isn't it?

76
00:09:57,166 --> 00:10:00,332
Please talk to me, Veer Pratap
Singh. l've come to help you.

77
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:08,415
22 years ago you remained silent.
And no one could defend you.

78
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:15,749
Today, God is giving you
another chance. Talk to me..

79
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:20,582
..and l promise to get
you back to your country.

80
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:24,665
Please talk to me. Please.

81
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,582
l don't know why you
don't want your freedom.

82
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:37,165
But l want you to know why..

83
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:40,915
..your freedom is important for me
and other girls of this country.

84
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:48,040
My father fought his entire life
for women's empowerment in Pakistan.

85
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:53,499
But he could not do as
much as he wanted to.

86
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:59,749
Today, after years of hard work,
l have earned my first case.

87
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:05,915
But everyone knows it's
impossible to win this case.

88
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:08,915
They want me to lose..

89
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:14,415
..so that no woman will tread
into this male domain again.

90
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,915
But l'm not going to lose.

91
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:24,332
l will not let down my father's
dream. Or the women of my country.

92
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,665
l just need your help. Talk to me..

93
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,082
Please talk to me.

94
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,915
Talk to me, Veer Pratap Singh.

95
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:23,915
That's an F 1 6 flying
at the speed of 1 200mph.

96
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:33,999
When a plane tears through the
skies, plays with the clouds..

97
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:41,915
..no one but a pilot can
understand that feeling.

98
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:53,999
l can still feel
my hands throbbing..

99
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:59,915
..the blood rushing
and the winds lashing..

100
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:08,665
..when l would take my helicopter..

101
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:11,915
..into the mountains.

102
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:36,415
Ahead.. left..

103
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:43,915
Help. Help, help please.

104
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:45,665
Let's go get them.

105
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,249
Help.

106
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,665
This was me and this was my life.

107
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,415
Squadron Leader Veer Pratap Singh.

108
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:23,749
A rescue pilot with
the lndian Air Force.

109
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:26,915
l loved my work.

110
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:31,999
Flying was a childhood fantasy.
And saνing people's lives..

111
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:36,165
..was my father's legacy.
He was an army officer..

112
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,332
..who gaνe his life for the country.

113
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:42,832
l was alone and free.

114
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:45,499
And l lived every moment
as if it were the last.

115
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:50,999
Little did l know
that three days later..

116
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:54,665
..my life was going to
change because of a girl.

117
00:14:56,166 --> 00:15:00,499
A girl who was then
sound asleep in Pakistan.

118
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:07,749
Wake up, Zaara. lt's seven o'clock.

119
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:11,082
Seven. l've never
woken up this early..

120
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:12,999
Whatever has not happened till now..

121
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:16,582
..will begin from today. Your
marriage got fixed yesterday.

122
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:19,165
Now, you're just a
guest here for some time.

123
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:22,165
Soon, you'll have to go
to your husband's house.

124
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,499
Your mother wants you
to change your habits.

125
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:29,749
Wake up every morning at seven,
make your own bed.

126
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:33,915
Then learn cooking
from uncle lqbal..

127
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:36,165
l'm not going to change
for anyone.

128
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,332
l am who l am, tell them that.

129
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:43,165
Oh, your cool
attitude won't work anymore.

130
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:46,582
You're lucky they've chosen
you because of your beauty.

131
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:48,915
l hope your manners
won't turn them away.

132
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:50,915
Or you'll be a spinster for life.

133
00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:01,999


134
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:29,332
"l am the way l am
and l will always be."

135
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:34,415
"Whether someone is happy,
or even if they are unhappy."

136
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:39,332
"l will neνer change my style."

137
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:43,915
"Whether they understand or
they don't, l will keep saying."

138
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:53,915
"l am the way l am
and l will always be."

139
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:47,749
"l am the princess of my
feelings and the queen of my mind."

140
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:52,665
"Why should l wear a veil?
lf the scarf drops, let it."

141
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:57,915
"Whether they smile or they pout.."

142
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:02,582
"lt does not bother me if
what l say causes a rift."

143
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:12,499
"l am the way l am
and l will always be."

144
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,582
"l have no desire to
adorn my palms with henna."

145
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:06,582
"Or to hear the wedding flute play."

146
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,999
"l have no desire to
adorn my palms with henna."

147
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:15,915
"Or to hear the wedding flute play."

148
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:20,915
"l am quite happy in
my own home, thank you."

149
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:25,915
"lf you can hear me, oh priest,
let me clarify."

150
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:30,749
"l don't know that l will
ever agree to marriage."

151
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:40,499
"l am the way l am
and l will always be."

152
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:45,499
"Whether anybody's happy or upset.."

153
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:50,332
".. l won't change myself."

154
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:54,915
"People might agree or they
might not, l won't budge."

155
00:19:55,166 --> 00:20:05,165
"l am the way l am
and l will always be."

156
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:37,249
Dr. Yusuf, is everything all right?

157
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:42,749
Just pray. Now, there's no
time to take her to the hospital.

158
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,165
She's repeatedly asking for Zaara.

159
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,582
Yusuf, l'm Zaara's mother but it's
Bebe (grandma) who brought her up.

160
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:54,665
Where is Zaara?

161
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:58,749
She's gone to the temple
to get holy water for Bebe.

162
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:03,165
l'll break this news to Zaara,
no one will say anything to her.

163
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:23,915
Zaara, is that you?

164
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:27,999
Yes, Bebe, your Zaara has come and..

165
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:30,749
..look what she's got for you.

166
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:34,999
The priest sent special holy water
for you and.. - l know, little one.

167
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:39,832
No holy water will help me now.
- Bebe..

168
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:43,582
Since you were a child, you
haνe been chattering non stop.

169
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:48,332
And l have been listening. Today,
l'm going to speak.

170
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:50,082
And you'll listen.

171
00:21:54,916 --> 00:22:00,665
You know that l've been here ever
since the inception of Pakistan.

172
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:05,999
l was 1 6-years-old when
your grandfather left lndia..

173
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:10,040
..and he came to Pakistan and
he brought me along with him.

174
00:22:10,833 --> 00:22:14,749
Your family, this
country has given me lots..

175
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,665
..and l took it all
with all my heart.

176
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:24,749
But today, l've this one
last wish.. will you fulfil it?

177
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:31,915
lmmerse my ashes in my lndia, dear.

178
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:39,499
l may be an orphan, but l am an
lndian. That's my only identity.

179
00:22:40,416 --> 00:22:43,999
l told you about Kiritpur,
haνen't l? For us Sikhs..

180
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:46,915
..it's a very important pilgrimage.

181
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:49,665
All my ancestors are there.

182
00:22:49,916 --> 00:22:55,915
Just immerse me there.
l will get my refuge.

183
00:22:58,916 --> 00:23:00,915
You'll do this for me?

184
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:06,165
No.

185
00:23:08,416 --> 00:23:10,332
There's going to be no
need to do any such thing.

186
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:13,415
All our visas to go
to Delhi are ready.

187
00:23:14,333 --> 00:23:18,499
You just get well soon. Then
we'll both go to your Kiritpur.

188
00:23:19,166 --> 00:23:21,582
And you can pray there
to your heart's content.

189
00:23:22,333 --> 00:23:24,749
Now, drink this holy water quickly.

190
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:35,499
Bebe..

191
00:24:02,416 --> 00:24:05,749
She was here in
Pakistan and you in lndia.

192
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:10,249
Then how and when did
the two of you meet?

193
00:24:15,166 --> 00:24:18,249
Three.. three days later..

194
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:26,249
..and what an unusual
meeting it was.

195
00:24:27,083 --> 00:24:28,249
Hurry up. Hurry up.

196
00:24:31,083 --> 00:24:33,415
A bus had toppled
over in the mountains.

197
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:38,915
There were no serious casualties.
All passengers were rescued.

198
00:24:40,166 --> 00:24:46,249
And l was on my way down
to bring the last girl up.

199
00:25:17,416 --> 00:25:18,499
Pull us up.

200
00:25:24,083 --> 00:25:27,915
lt wasn't that l'd never seen
a more beautiful girl than her.

201
00:25:29,166 --> 00:25:33,499
But l don't know why l
couldn't take my eyes off her.

202
00:25:34,583 --> 00:25:38,332
Her eyes were lowered and
she was breathing heavily.

203
00:25:39,166 --> 00:25:40,582
She was very scared.

204
00:25:42,083 --> 00:25:45,499
A strand of hair was
bothering her right eye.

205
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,999
She was trying to move it,
but the wind was strong and..

206
00:25:50,083 --> 00:25:52,165
..the hair stayed there.

207
00:25:53,083 --> 00:25:56,332
As l lifted my hand from
her waist to move the hair..

208
00:25:57,083 --> 00:25:59,082
..she looked at me in fear.

209
00:26:00,333 --> 00:26:04,249
We looked at each
other for the first time.

210
00:26:05,083 --> 00:26:07,082
She kept staring at me scared.

211
00:26:08,916 --> 00:26:12,915
Then she lowered her gaze, but..

212
00:26:13,166 --> 00:26:17,415
l kept staring at her and
then my dream was broken.

213
00:26:19,083 --> 00:26:22,249
Stop.. stop.. stop

214
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,582
Ranjit. Stop.

215
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:25,165
What happened?

216
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,582
What happened?
- My bag has fallen down.

217
00:26:29,666 --> 00:26:32,165
Please take me down.
- lt's only a bag, ma'am. Let it go.

218
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:35,332
l can't let it go. That
bag is very inνaluable to me.

219
00:26:35,416 --> 00:26:37,832
Not more valuable than all
our lives, right? - Yes, it is.

220
00:26:37,916 --> 00:26:42,165
Now, will you please take me
down or should l go myself? - Down.

221
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:43,332
My bag.

222
00:26:43,416 --> 00:26:44,749
Stop it.

223
00:26:44,916 --> 00:26:47,165
Ranjit, take it down.
- Veer, have you gone mad?

224
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:48,915
Do as l say. Take us down.

225
00:27:00,333 --> 00:27:01,415
Here.

226
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,165
Ranjit, pull us up.

227
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,915
You endangered the liνes of so
many people for a little bag.

228
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,999
What kind of a person are you?

229
00:27:26,083 --> 00:27:27,999
You know we risk our lives
everyday to save liνes..

230
00:27:28,083 --> 00:27:30,999
..of people who are
complete strangers..

231
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:35,249
..who aren't related to us
in any way.

232
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,999
Yet on our way home, our
hearts swell with pride..

233
00:27:40,083 --> 00:27:41,999
..that we saved someone's sister,
wife, brother or mother.

234
00:27:42,083 --> 00:27:45,249
Gave someone a new life.

235
00:27:46,708 --> 00:27:48,999
But today, for the first
time in so many years..

236
00:27:49,083 --> 00:27:50,165
..l'm doubting my work.

237
00:27:51,166 --> 00:27:52,999
For the first time,
sacrificing my life..

238
00:27:53,083 --> 00:27:54,999
..for someone else
is seeming worthless.

239
00:27:55,083 --> 00:27:56,165
lt's seeming wrong.

240
00:27:57,083 --> 00:27:59,749
l'm sorry, ma'am,
but it was disgusting.

241
00:28:07,583 --> 00:28:10,582
Get out. l don't
want to see your face.

242
00:28:10,833 --> 00:28:13,415
Who asked you to
give Zaara your money?

243
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:17,665
You know l can't say no to Zaara.

244
00:28:17,916 --> 00:28:20,165
Even if l did, she
would've taken it forcibly.

245
00:28:20,416 --> 00:28:23,999
And she's not off to the market
to buy bangles, but to lndia.

246
00:28:24,083 --> 00:28:26,999
Wasn't it important
enough to tell me?

247
00:28:27,083 --> 00:28:29,082
She made me pledge our friendship.

248
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:32,332
Pledge of friendship.
There's a limit to childishness.

249
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,915
Who got her onto the bus?
Call Akram.

250
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,249
Call him immediately.
How irresponsible!

251
00:28:39,625 --> 00:28:44,332
Zaara.. Zaara, are you all right?
- Zaara..

252
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:47,749
Mother, l'm perfectly all right,
please don't worry.

253
00:28:47,916 --> 00:28:52,665
What is this nonsense, Zaara?
Do you know what l'm going through?

254
00:28:53,208 --> 00:28:57,415
Only when l was going to the police
that this idiot Shabbo told me.

255
00:28:57,916 --> 00:29:00,415
Just come back home right away.
Come home immediately.

256
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,999
Mother, the border closes at 4.30..

257
00:29:03,083 --> 00:29:06,165
..and l haven't even
reached Kiritpur yet.

258
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,999
God, for what sin am
l being punished?

259
00:29:08,083 --> 00:29:10,749
Now, it's about to be evening.

260
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:13,249
Why did you go alone?

261
00:29:13,375 --> 00:29:17,165
l promised you that
l would send the ashes to lndia.

262
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:21,332
l also promised Bebe that
l would take her ashes myself.

263
00:29:21,458 --> 00:29:23,999
Zaara, is this a little
trip from Lahore to Pindi..

264
00:29:24,083 --> 00:29:25,499
..that you just took off like that?

265
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:26,832
Have you gone mad?

266
00:29:26,916 --> 00:29:27,999
l'm really sorry, Mother.

267
00:29:28,583 --> 00:29:33,082
But after all my explaining, you
were still unable to understand me.

268
00:29:34,916 --> 00:29:38,082
Until now, l've done nothing
really important in my life, Mother.

269
00:29:38,916 --> 00:29:41,915
Nor will l be doing
anything great in the future.

270
00:29:43,125 --> 00:29:48,749
My life, like yours, will be spent
being a good wife and a good mother.

271
00:29:50,125 --> 00:29:52,915
But after doing this, l will
always be proud of myself.

272
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,749
That l helped
someone attain salvation.

273
00:30:00,208 --> 00:30:01,999
Mother, now that l've come so far..

274
00:30:02,083 --> 00:30:04,415
..l will return only
after completing my work.

275
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:09,165
But if you stay angry with me,
then my journey will get bad luck..

276
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:12,332
Stop it. Can a mother ever
wish bad luck for her daughter?

277
00:30:12,458 --> 00:30:14,915
l've been crying since eight hours,
you want me to cry some more?

278
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,915
Relax, Mother. l'm cool.

279
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:21,165
Yes, you're the only one
who's cool and we're all fools.

280
00:30:21,833 --> 00:30:25,165
lf your father returns
before you do, then..

281
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:26,415
Don't worry, Mother.

282
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:30,665
Papa will only be back next week,
and l'm coming back tomorrow.

283
00:30:30,833 --> 00:30:31,915
Please.

284
00:30:32,208 --> 00:30:34,915
Mother, l've to hang up now.
There's a long queue.

285
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,082
Listen, take care of yourself,
and don't eat any junk.

286
00:30:38,291 --> 00:30:42,415
And don't talk to any strangers
and keep calling me.. right?

287
00:30:42,916 --> 00:30:47,999
And don't be scared, my
blessings are with you. Goodbye.

288
00:30:48,416 --> 00:30:49,499
Goodbye.

289
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,165
Yes, how much?

290
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:53,082
Why are you worrying?

291
00:30:53,333 --> 00:30:57,749
Our Zaara is no less than any boy.
She can get her way anywhere.

292
00:30:58,458 --> 00:31:03,749
Thank God that she's safe, this
girl scared the life out of me.

293
00:31:05,125 --> 00:31:08,082
Why are you talking to me? l
told you to get out of my sight.

294
00:31:08,416 --> 00:31:11,832
You say that all the time.
Now, cool it.

295
00:31:12,125 --> 00:31:14,749
Cool it, my foot! You fool.

296
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,832
Go do your work. What are you
standing like statues for? Go..

297
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,582
Ranjit, permission for my
leave has come from the base.

298
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,915
Mom and dad had asked me to come
home to celebrate Lodi (festival).

299
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,832
l'll leave from here in the morning,
that way l'll reach sooner.

300
00:31:30,458 --> 00:31:31,540
Negi will accompany you back.

301
00:31:31,666 --> 00:31:34,999
Okay, see you on Monday. Enjoy..
- Thank you. Here are the logs..

302
00:31:35,708 --> 00:31:38,332
Mister, are there any
buses to Kiritpur from here?

303
00:31:38,458 --> 00:31:40,082
No, Ma'am, no buses
leaving right now.

304
00:31:40,291 --> 00:31:42,582
There's one for Kiritpur at 7am.

305
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,915
ls there a hotel where
l can spend the night?

306
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:51,749
Hotel. Of course. Look there's
Kake's inn. Our five-star hotel.

307
00:31:52,125 --> 00:31:53,999
For Rs. 1 0, you'll get a blanket.

308
00:31:54,083 --> 00:31:55,165
You'll get a cot for Rs.25.

309
00:31:55,458 --> 00:31:58,832
Okay, ma'am. Please excuse me,
l'm getting late. Goodnight

310
00:32:03,416 --> 00:32:12,999
"Love is God's blessing,
don't turn away from it.

311
00:32:13,083 --> 00:32:15,082
The ascent of moon doesn't stop."

312
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:26,082
"Why hide it?"

313
00:32:26,333 --> 00:32:32,999
"Love can never be hidden, Jaggiya."

314
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,082
You risk your life to
save the liνes of strangers.

315
00:32:45,166 --> 00:32:46,999
There can't be nobler
work than that.

316
00:32:48,291 --> 00:32:52,499
l would not like you to stop taking
pride in your work because of me.

317
00:32:53,458 --> 00:32:55,749
That's why l've come to tell
you the reason for my behaviour.

318
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,499
These are the ashes of my Bebe.

319
00:33:01,833 --> 00:33:03,332
She was an lndian..

320
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:08,749
..who spent her whole life in
Pakistan serving my family..

321
00:33:09,416 --> 00:33:11,082
..and never asked
for anything in return.

322
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,999
Just one dying wish..

323
00:33:14,083 --> 00:33:18,915
..that her ashes be immersed along
with her ancestors in Kiritpur.

324
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,582
This is more
important to me than my life.

325
00:33:25,458 --> 00:33:28,082
Perhaps, you were not
happy saving my life.

326
00:33:28,833 --> 00:33:29,999
But l am sure you'll be proud that..

327
00:33:30,083 --> 00:33:36,665
..you saved this urn
that was in my bag.

328
00:33:40,666 --> 00:33:42,582
Please try to forgive me.

329
00:33:45,333 --> 00:33:46,415
l'm sorry.

330
00:33:54,291 --> 00:33:57,499
Sir, here's your buttermilk.
- Thanks.

331
00:33:58,833 --> 00:34:02,082
lf only l'd drunk it in the morning,
l wouldn't have lost my temper then.

332
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,999
Here's the bus.

333
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:14,749
One by one. Who has tickets?

334
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:22,582
l've got a ticket..
- Ladies first. No pushing.

335
00:34:24,583 --> 00:34:25,915
Easy..

336
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,165
Easy.. easy. No crowding.

337
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:30,665
That's it. No more.
- But l've got a ticket.

338
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:34,665
Madam, everyone has a ticket but
here it's first-come-first-sit.

339
00:34:34,916 --> 00:34:37,499
So, where do l go then?
- Go up there..

340
00:34:43,166 --> 00:34:47,082
Hey, baldy, move oνer there.
- Why should l moνe?

341
00:34:47,416 --> 00:34:48,999
ls my wife your sister that..

342
00:34:49,083 --> 00:34:52,332
..you want to sit beside
her for the entire journey?

343
00:34:52,416 --> 00:34:57,415
Shove, before l break your teeth.
- Sir, l was just moving.

344
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:06,499
You must be wondering
what am l doing here.

345
00:35:08,916 --> 00:35:09,999
Can you see that bus over there?

346
00:35:10,083 --> 00:35:15,665
Actually l should've
been on that bus.

347
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:17,999
l had boarded it. But l
noticed you and l saw..

348
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:23,332
..how graciously you
took this wonderful seat.

349
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:28,999
l thought to myself either
you are extremely brave or..

350
00:35:29,083 --> 00:35:32,582
..extremely foolish to do this
long journey all by yourself.

351
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,082
Then l realised that..

352
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:36,999
..although l'll reach my village,
l'll be bothered..

353
00:35:37,083 --> 00:35:38,999
..throughout my journey..

354
00:35:39,083 --> 00:35:41,999
..and probably for my
entire life whether..

355
00:35:42,083 --> 00:35:45,999
..that silly Pakistani girl reached
her destination safe and sound.

356
00:35:47,916 --> 00:35:50,332
So, please don't think
that l've come to help you.

357
00:35:50,833 --> 00:35:52,999
l'm simply ensuring your
thoughts don't bother me..

358
00:35:53,083 --> 00:35:55,249
..for the rest of my life.

359
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:57,332
Thank you.

360
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:59,165
Would you like to eat some nuts?

361
00:36:04,916 --> 00:36:06,915
By the way, l'm Squadron
Leader Veer Pratap Singh.

362
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:10,665
l'm Zaara. Zaara Hayaat Khan.

363
00:36:11,458 --> 00:36:21,457


364
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:26,249
"Below the blue skies."

365
00:36:26,583 --> 00:36:29,915
"The earth is prospering."

366
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,165
"Every season is joyful."

367
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,415
"Oh, my beautiful land."

368
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:45,832
"My land. My land."

369
00:36:48,416 --> 00:36:52,499
"Oh, my beautiful land."

370
00:36:52,583 --> 00:36:56,915
"My land. My land."

371
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:17,165
"The earth is golden,
the skies are blue."

372
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:19,499
"And every season is colourful."

373
00:37:19,583 --> 00:37:30,665
"This is my land."

374
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:40,332
"The sparrow hawk calls
and the nightingale sings."

375
00:37:40,416 --> 00:37:44,665
"And the monsoon clouds arrive.
This is my land."

376
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:53,999
"This is my land."

377
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:05,082
"A crow is calling on my terrace."

378
00:38:05,291 --> 00:38:12,999
"A letter from my
beloved will arrive."

379
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:25,999
"And there'll surely
be a mention of me."

380
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:40,582
"When the wind moves like a comb
through the fields of wheat.."

381
00:38:40,916 --> 00:38:46,749
"lt lifts a hundred
colourful scarves."

382
00:38:52,666 --> 00:38:57,832
"When the water carriers come to
the well to fill their pots.."

383
00:38:58,375 --> 00:39:03,332
"Someone entrances them with
the sweet sound of his flute."

384
00:39:03,416 --> 00:39:09,749
"And so at every step.."

385
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,165
"And so at every step, a
new love story is born."

386
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:26,499
"This is my land."

387
00:39:40,708 --> 00:39:47,999
"My Jugni is very choosy.
She favours the ones in love.

388
00:39:48,083 --> 00:39:54,749
My dear this is what Jugni says.
She takes the name of Lord."

389
00:40:01,583 --> 00:40:04,332
"You've made me happy, dear!"

390
00:40:09,708 --> 00:40:13,999
"Where children, carried
upon their father's shoulders.."

391
00:40:14,083 --> 00:40:18,082
"..are taken to see the fair.
And treated to comic shows."

392
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:21,415
"And ice-cream and snacks."

393
00:40:26,833 --> 00:40:29,665
"And to candy and savouries."

394
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:32,415
"These innocent
children as dear as dolls."

395
00:40:32,625 --> 00:40:49,749
"Are entertained by their
grandmothers with fairy tales."

396
00:40:49,833 --> 00:41:01,332
"This is my land."

397
00:41:07,583 --> 00:41:11,999
"Hurry up, dear."

398
00:41:12,083 --> 00:41:16,415
"A throne pricked
your beloved's feet."

399
00:41:16,833 --> 00:41:21,999
"Dear, a throne
pricked your beloved's feet."

400
00:41:23,458 --> 00:41:27,832
"Who will be the one to remove it?"

401
00:41:27,916 --> 00:41:32,332
"Who will endure the
pain of your beloved?"

402
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:38,249
"Dear who will endure
the pain of your beloved?"

403
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:50,415
"ln my country, a
guest is revered as God."

404
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:53,999
"And no matter what
land he comes from..

405
00:41:54,083 --> 00:41:56,915
..he becomes a part of this land."

406
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:19,332
"l have seen and
understood your country."

407
00:42:19,583 --> 00:42:24,749
"l don't know why it
all seems familiar."

408
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:34,332
"These evenings are
familiar as are these mornings."

409
00:42:34,416 --> 00:42:38,749
"Such is also my country.
Same as your land."

410
00:42:39,416 --> 00:42:44,832
"Same as your land."

411
00:42:45,166 --> 00:42:56,415
"This is my land,
same as your land."

412
00:42:56,750 --> 00:43:02,415
"This is my land."

413
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,249
What are these people doing?

414
00:43:42,333 --> 00:43:44,749
These are the last rites.

415
00:43:44,833 --> 00:43:46,249
lt is done before the ashes
are immersed in the river.

416
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:50,999
So, why aren't we doing it?
- We aren't doing it because..

417
00:43:51,083 --> 00:43:53,915
..you are a Muslim. And
this is a temple of the Sikhs.

418
00:43:54,291 --> 00:43:55,999
And it's in our interest to
quietly immerse the ashes and..

419
00:43:56,083 --> 00:43:57,415
..leave from here.

420
00:43:58,583 --> 00:44:02,915
No, l want to immerse the
ashes with the complete rituals.

421
00:44:03,083 --> 00:44:07,082
No, no, Zaara. lt's like this..
some priests are fanatics.

422
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:10,499
So, you'll get insulted and
l'll get beaten up unnecessarily.

423
00:44:11,916 --> 00:44:13,999
Should l go and ask?
- No, no, you don't ask.

424
00:44:14,083 --> 00:44:18,249
Wait here. l'll ask.
You sit right here.. please.

425
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:22,915
Dear God, it's all
in your blessings.

426
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:29,832
l'd told you about Kiritpur, right?
Just immerse me there.

427
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:31,915
l'll get refuge.

428
00:44:50,416 --> 00:44:51,499
ls your name Zaara?

429
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:52,665
Yes.

430
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:54,415
You've come from Pakistan? Yes..

431
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:59,832
l've been in this
temple since 42 years.

432
00:45:01,458 --> 00:45:03,582
But l have never seen
such devotion.

433
00:45:05,666 --> 00:45:08,915
You've done more than
a real daughter would.

434
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,915
lt would be an honour for me to
do the last rites for your Bebe.

435
00:45:13,875 --> 00:45:16,165
Come, dear, come with me. Come..

436
00:45:21,666 --> 00:45:24,582
Dear God, it's all
in your blessings.

437
00:45:52,333 --> 00:45:53,415
Come here, please.

438
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,082
Now what?

439
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,165
Put your hand out and
fulfil Bebe's last wish with me.

440
00:46:06,583 --> 00:46:07,999
But how can l..

441
00:46:08,625 --> 00:46:12,999
Look here, neither l, nor
you are Bebe's children. But..

442
00:46:13,083 --> 00:46:16,165
lf it weren't for you l
wouldn't have been able to get..

443
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:18,665
..Bebe here so easily.

444
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,665
Like me, now, you too have
formed a bond with Bebe.

445
00:46:24,833 --> 00:46:25,999
So, the right..

446
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:28,415
..to perform this final rite
is not just mine, but yours too.

447
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,082
Come.

448
00:47:02,333 --> 00:47:05,999
Zaara, here's your bus ticket.
You'll reach Atari. And from there..

449
00:47:06,083 --> 00:47:09,165
..catch a train straight to Lahore.
And here's your change.

450
00:47:09,916 --> 00:47:10,999
Have you finished eating?

451
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,332
Anything else?
- No, thanks.

452
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:21,665
You've already done a lot for me.
l don't know how to thank you.

453
00:47:22,416 --> 00:47:24,749
l'm very frank about
these things. lf you ask me.

454
00:47:24,833 --> 00:47:28,832
l'll tell you what l really want.
- Tell me what l can do for you?

455
00:47:29,916 --> 00:47:34,082
Be careful, l will ask, but
you will not be able to give it.

456
00:47:35,583 --> 00:47:39,915
You don't know what you've done
for me. Ask for anything you want.

457
00:47:40,333 --> 00:47:41,749
lt's a promise that l'll fulfil it.

458
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:45,999
You are making a promise
without knowing the price.

459
00:47:46,083 --> 00:47:47,749
You might regret it.

460
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:51,665
A Pakistani has made a
promise to an lndian.

461
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,249
Now, my country's honour
is at stake.

462
00:47:54,875 --> 00:47:56,582
Now, even if l want to,
l can't back off.

463
00:47:57,125 --> 00:47:59,332
Please tell me what
can l do for you?

464
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,082
Give me this one day
from your life..

465
00:48:08,416 --> 00:48:09,499
What?

466
00:48:11,291 --> 00:48:13,082
You drew me close into your life.

467
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,374
You created a bond
between me and your Bebe.

468
00:48:17,166 --> 00:48:20,832
You're leaving me with a
lifetime of sweet memories.

469
00:48:23,458 --> 00:48:27,999
l want to share my world with you.
l too wish to give you memories..

470
00:48:28,083 --> 00:48:31,915
..that stay with you for
the rest of your life.

471
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,082
l know a day is very precious
to you. But l promise that..

472
00:48:40,166 --> 00:48:44,165
..you'll never forget this day.

473
00:48:50,708 --> 00:48:55,499
l warned you that you'd
regret making this promise.

474
00:49:12,666 --> 00:49:14,249
So, you fell in love with her?

475
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,665
What l felt..

476
00:49:25,083 --> 00:49:27,499
l still can't understand.

477
00:49:30,416 --> 00:49:34,915
Why l asked her for a day, l
don't know.. l just asked her.

478
00:49:36,666 --> 00:49:39,999
But yes, at that time, l did
feel that our acquaintance..

479
00:49:40,083 --> 00:49:44,165
..was not destined to
end right here.

480
00:49:44,916 --> 00:49:47,915
We hadn't met just to
come till here.

481
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:54,999
Our relationship was
still incomplete.

482
00:49:55,083 --> 00:49:58,665
There was still
something more to happen.

483
00:50:01,916 --> 00:50:06,415
With this thought, the
words blurted out of my mouth..

484
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:10,582
..and that poor girl
listened to me silently.

485
00:50:13,708 --> 00:50:15,082
Did she come with you?

486
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,332
Saamiya, the honour of
your Pakistan was at stake.

487
00:50:27,833 --> 00:50:28,915
How could she not come?

488
00:50:39,416 --> 00:50:41,165
Why have you made that
strange face?

489
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:42,999
Your mother scolded
you on the phone?

490
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:47,832
l'm scared of heights.
- Why didn't you tell me earlier?

491
00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:50,332
You said this is a shorter route.

492
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:53,082
The other way would
take half a day more..

493
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,082
So, what could l do?
- Does that mean..

494
00:50:55,166 --> 00:50:57,915
..you'll wear this scary
expression for the entire journey?

495
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:01,582
Please smile a little,
or l'll get scared too.

496
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:06,249
Okay, listen, eat some nuts.
lt'll take your mind off this.

497
00:51:07,916 --> 00:51:09,832
Hold out your hand..
- No..

498
00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:12,332
Okay, open your mouth.

499
00:51:17,833 --> 00:51:18,915
More?

500
00:51:36,333 --> 00:51:45,999
Brother Veer has come. And
there's a girl with him.

501
00:51:46,416 --> 00:51:47,999
Hey, Pappu's mother,
look, our Veer has come.

502
00:51:48,083 --> 00:51:50,665
And he has brought
his fiancee with him.

503
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:53,832
Oh, a girl won't come just
like that with her fiance.

504
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,999
Veeru must have married her,
she must be his wife.

505
00:51:58,250 --> 00:52:02,582
Maati.. Maati..

506
00:52:04,208 --> 00:52:05,665
Maati.

507
00:52:07,708 --> 00:52:09,415
Maati.. Maati..

508
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,915
Oh, what happened? Who died now?

509
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:18,999
Maati, Veeru's here.

510
00:52:19,083 --> 00:52:20,665
Veeru?
- Yes

511
00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:24,332
And he's got his wife along
with him. - What rubbish!

512
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:28,082
My Veeru will never get
married without informing me.

513
00:52:28,166 --> 00:52:29,665
l'm telling the truth, Maati.

514
00:52:29,833 --> 00:52:32,082
The whole village has
come out to see them..

515
00:52:36,416 --> 00:52:39,999
What the hell! Let him come.
l'm not going to talk to him.

516
00:52:42,375 --> 00:52:46,999
Oh, Chaudhary Sumer Singh, where the
hell are you? Where's he gone now?

517
00:53:06,166 --> 00:53:07,915
Come on.

518
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,915
Oh, Chaudhary Sumer Singh.

519
00:53:13,666 --> 00:53:16,832
Father, Maati's calling you.
- Yes, right. l heard her..

520
00:53:17,291 --> 00:53:18,749
She always calls me
at the wrong time.

521
00:53:18,833 --> 00:53:20,749
Come here, son. l'll
tell you something.

522
00:53:21,458 --> 00:53:22,999
Don't ever make the mistake of
getting married. lf you do..

523
00:53:23,083 --> 00:53:26,165
..you won't be able to score a goal..

524
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:28,249
..for the rest of your life. - All
right, sir. - Chaudhary Sumer Singh.

525
00:53:28,333 --> 00:53:29,415
l'm coming.

526
00:53:30,125 --> 00:53:32,999
Oh, my dear one, how many
times do l have to tell you..

527
00:53:33,083 --> 00:53:36,165
..not to disturb me during a game.
- And how many times do l tell you..

528
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:39,332
..if you want to die then lie
down on a bed and die. Don't play..

529
00:53:39,416 --> 00:53:41,499
..with kids old enough
to be your grandchildren..

530
00:53:41,583 --> 00:53:43,582
..and get your bones broken.

531
00:53:43,875 --> 00:53:45,999
Let me tell you one thing.
ln this entire village..

532
00:53:46,083 --> 00:53:48,832
..there's not a single player
who can compete with Sumer Singh.

533
00:53:49,625 --> 00:53:52,749
Except your son, look
what he's been up to.

534
00:53:52,916 --> 00:53:57,582
Veeru's come? Where?
- But not alone. He's got married.

535
00:53:58,416 --> 00:54:00,082
What are you saying?
- Look there.

536
00:54:00,833 --> 00:54:02,832
Hello, Uncle.

537
00:54:08,041 --> 00:54:10,082
Hey, listen. Go there.

538
00:54:16,833 --> 00:54:17,999
How're you, Kamli?
- Fine.

539
00:54:18,083 --> 00:54:20,165
l'll say hi to father.
Your blessings, father.

540
00:54:20,250 --> 00:54:23,999
You idiot! Without asking or
telling us, you got married?

541
00:54:24,083 --> 00:54:25,999
l'll thrash you.
- Married? Who told you that?

542
00:54:26,083 --> 00:54:27,165
Then who's she? My wife?
- No, no.

543
00:54:27,250 --> 00:54:29,915
Your wife is right here.
- l'll hit you.

544
00:54:30,083 --> 00:54:32,415
Then who's she?
- You're too much, Maati.

545
00:54:32,666 --> 00:54:33,999
ls there only one kind
of relationship between..

546
00:54:34,083 --> 00:54:35,415
..a man and a woman?

547
00:54:36,083 --> 00:54:37,165
Bless me.

548
00:54:37,250 --> 00:54:39,999
She's our guest, Father. After
saving her in a rescue operation..

549
00:54:40,083 --> 00:54:42,415
..l got her here to show her our
village and to make her meet you.

550
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:43,582
You're making
mountain out of a molehill.

551
00:54:48,333 --> 00:54:52,999
Of course. l
understood the moment l saw her.

552
00:54:53,083 --> 00:54:56,582
Such a beautiful girl with a
fool like you.. impossible.

553
00:54:57,208 --> 00:55:01,082
What's your name, dear?
- Zaara, sir. Zaara Hayaat Khan.

554
00:55:01,875 --> 00:55:04,915
What a lovely name.
Where are you from, dear?

555
00:55:05,250 --> 00:55:06,540
From Pakistan.

556
00:55:06,625 --> 00:55:07,999
Oh, wow, that's fantastic.

557
00:55:08,083 --> 00:55:11,165
Then you're our
extra-special guest. Look..

558
00:55:11,250 --> 00:55:14,915
We've served the
people of our country a lot.

559
00:55:15,125 --> 00:55:16,207
But this is our first
chance to be hospitable..

560
00:55:16,291 --> 00:55:17,832
..to our neighbouring country.

561
00:55:17,916 --> 00:55:19,290
What would you like to eat?
Should l get some butter milk?

562
00:55:19,375 --> 00:55:21,832
Some milk, some..
- Oh, enough.

563
00:55:21,916 --> 00:55:22,999
Come with me.

564
00:55:23,083 --> 00:55:24,999
lf you get caught up in his chatter,
it'll be nightfall soon.

565
00:55:25,083 --> 00:55:26,832
Move aside.
- Okay, never mind me.

566
00:55:26,916 --> 00:55:28,082
Make way.
- Oh, yes

567
00:55:31,250 --> 00:55:34,832
Veeru, where're you going?
Wait a minute.

568
00:55:35,166 --> 00:55:37,165
All of you get going.

569
00:55:37,583 --> 00:55:39,999
Yes, one minute..
- What?

570
00:55:40,083 --> 00:55:44,082
Yes?
- Well, have you got my things?

571
00:55:45,708 --> 00:55:48,999
Yes. Here's your bottle of rum.

572
00:55:49,083 --> 00:55:50,707
Don't drink it all alone. - No way.

573
00:55:50,791 --> 00:55:53,582
lf Maati catches you this time
around, l'm not going to lie to her.

574
00:55:54,583 --> 00:55:58,665
Just once more.. one last time..
- Okay, last time.

575
00:55:58,750 --> 00:56:00,499
Now, go. Go.

576
00:56:03,833 --> 00:56:05,457
Cheers to the neighbouring country.

577
00:56:16,166 --> 00:56:19,249
Come, l'll do that.
- No, l'll manage.

578
00:56:19,708 --> 00:56:21,749
The way you're
making it, it's evident.

579
00:56:21,833 --> 00:56:23,415
Someone else ties your hair at home.

580
00:56:24,083 --> 00:56:29,332
Come, l'll make it for you.
Just feel at home. Come.

581
00:56:31,416 --> 00:56:33,415
This is Veer's room, right? - Yes

582
00:56:34,916 --> 00:56:39,665
Whenever he'd get a medal or
a photo, l'd hang it up here.

583
00:56:40,750 --> 00:56:43,999
And when he's not at home,
then his father and l..

584
00:56:44,083 --> 00:56:49,165
..warm our eyes looking at them.
- There's a lot of love..

585
00:56:49,250 --> 00:56:51,332
..between the three of you.
- Because there's no one else..

586
00:56:51,416 --> 00:56:53,249
..to share our love with.

587
00:56:54,458 --> 00:56:57,415
His mother and father passed
away when he was really small.

588
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,165
Since then we're the
only ones for him.

589
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:03,082
We're actually his aunt
and uncle.

590
00:57:03,833 --> 00:57:06,832
But he calls us his
father and mother.

591
00:57:08,333 --> 00:57:10,165
We don't have any
children of our own.

592
00:57:11,583 --> 00:57:18,415
So, it's just the three of us.
Look, your plait is ready.

593
00:57:21,083 --> 00:57:25,332
Hey. l look just like all of you.
- This is nothing.

594
00:57:25,708 --> 00:57:29,332
You'll look like a true Punjabi
girl tonight. lt's Lodi tonight.

595
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:32,082
And here, we celebrate
it with a lot of pomp.

596
00:57:32,458 --> 00:57:35,832
l'll take out the dress l
wore for my first Lodi for you.

597
00:57:36,208 --> 00:57:39,749
No, Maati, l'll wear my own clothes.
- You call me mother..

598
00:57:39,833 --> 00:57:41,165
..and at the same time
argue with me?

599
00:57:42,083 --> 00:57:44,415
Look, you've come to
our house just for a day.

600
00:57:44,583 --> 00:57:47,082
For this one day at
least become one of us.

601
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:06,499
"Oh traveller, you've two
yellow and two red flowers."

602
00:58:06,916 --> 00:58:08,582
Are you comfortable?
- Yes.

603
00:58:08,666 --> 00:58:10,665
Like l was telling you.
When l was young..

604
00:58:11,416 --> 00:58:13,832
..l would take Maati on a cycle
like this right till Amritsar.

605
00:58:14,666 --> 00:58:18,582
Now, she's so become so fat
that she doesn't fit on a cycle.

606
00:58:18,750 --> 00:58:21,499
No, Father, she's not fat at all.
- Oh, you don't know. l know.

607
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:24,999
Veer was telling me that Maati and..

608
00:58:25,083 --> 00:58:27,582
..you have built this
village on your own. - Yes.

609
00:58:27,666 --> 00:58:31,415
That's right. At first,
there were just fields here.

610
00:58:32,250 --> 00:58:35,082
Then after writing many letters,
we arranged for electricity.

611
00:58:35,666 --> 00:58:37,915
Do you see that hospital?
- Yes.

612
00:58:38,208 --> 00:58:40,999
That was a cow shed earlier.
How are you, Doctor?

613
00:58:41,083 --> 00:58:42,165
Doing fine, sir.
- Very well, friend.

614
00:58:42,583 --> 00:58:44,082
And look, the children's school.

615
00:58:45,666 --> 00:58:47,499
Maati and l were the
first teachers here.

616
00:58:48,166 --> 00:58:49,582
No one knew how to read or write.

617
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:52,999
Now, the kids study
here till eighth grade.

618
00:58:53,416 --> 00:58:58,165
After that, the boys are sent off
to Kartarpur, for further studies.

619
00:58:58,875 --> 00:59:00,999
And what about the girls?
- lt's not possible for us..

620
00:59:01,083 --> 00:59:05,165
..to send the girls so far.
And anyway, they have to learn to..

621
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:07,832
..look after the household. So, what
use is higher education for them?

622
00:59:08,833 --> 00:59:10,332
That's not fair, Father.

623
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,999
Not fair? What do you mean by that?

624
00:59:16,083 --> 00:59:18,082
l hope you don't mind this, Father.

625
00:59:18,166 --> 00:59:20,249
What you and Maati have
done for this village..

626
00:59:20,333 --> 00:59:22,499
..would've have taken
people centuries to achieve.

627
00:59:23,666 --> 00:59:25,999
But while you made the men
capable of facing the world..

628
00:59:26,083 --> 00:59:29,082
..you disabled the women.

629
00:59:30,416 --> 00:59:32,999
That's why a Veer has
become an Air Force Pilot..

630
00:59:33,083 --> 00:59:36,165
..and the girls of the village
remain illiterate and unpolished.

631
00:59:38,083 --> 00:59:40,165
Girls today haνe reached the moon.

632
00:59:40,916 --> 00:59:43,165
They walk
shoulder-to-shoulder with men.

633
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:48,665
With education, perhaps, a girl from
this village could've outdone Veer.

634
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:50,582
Don't you think so, Father?

635
00:59:51,833 --> 00:59:55,915
Oh, Chaudhary Sumer Singh.
Where are you loitering?

636
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,082
Oh! Whenever l'm doing
something really important..

637
00:59:59,166 --> 01:00:01,915
..she comes and troubles me.
Yes, madam. Now what?

638
01:00:02,333 --> 01:00:05,499
lt's time to light the Lodi.
Come and get ready.

639
01:00:06,625 --> 01:00:07,749
All right, l'm coming.

640
01:00:08,666 --> 01:00:10,499
Come, dear. Let's light the Lodi.

641
01:00:17,083 --> 01:00:18,999
"Beautiful one like a ringlet one!"

642
01:00:19,083 --> 01:00:21,582
"Who will save you poor one?"

643
01:00:21,666 --> 01:00:23,749
"Dullah Bhatti is here for you."

644
01:00:23,833 --> 01:00:25,999
"The Dullah married off
his daughter."

645
01:00:26,083 --> 01:00:28,207
"He gave a measure of sugar!"

646
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:30,665
"The girl's shawl is torn."

647
01:00:30,750 --> 01:00:32,790
"Who will stitch her shawl?"

648
01:00:32,875 --> 01:00:34,999
"The landlords ravished her."

649
01:00:35,083 --> 01:00:36,999
"Beautiful one like a ringlet one!"

650
01:00:37,083 --> 01:00:39,332
"Who will save you poor one?"

651
01:00:39,416 --> 01:00:41,499
"Dullah Bhatti is here for you."

652
01:00:41,583 --> 01:00:43,707
"Beautiful one like a ringlet one!"

653
01:00:43,791 --> 01:00:45,832
"Who will save you poor one?"

654
01:00:45,916 --> 01:00:47,999
"Dullah Bhatti is here for you."

655
01:00:48,083 --> 01:00:50,165
"Beautiful one like a ringlet one!"

656
01:00:50,250 --> 01:00:52,499
"Who will save you poor one?"

657
01:00:52,583 --> 01:00:56,665
"Dullah Bhatti is here for you.
Who will save you poor one?"

658
01:00:56,750 --> 01:00:57,999
"Dullah Bhatti is here for you.

659
01:00:58,083 --> 01:01:01,082
Who will save you poor one?
Beautiful one like a ringlet one!"

660
01:01:02,458 --> 01:01:03,832
Listen everybody.

661
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,665
Come here. Come on.

662
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,082
Coming, Father.

663
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:11,249
Let's go there.. Coming.

664
01:01:12,166 --> 01:01:14,915
Everyone, listen to
what l have to say.

665
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:20,665
The cricket pitch that was going to
be made here.. will not happen now.

666
01:01:20,750 --> 01:01:21,832
Why?
- Why, Father?

667
01:01:21,916 --> 01:01:26,749
Relax, l'm telling you. Because now
we're building a girls high school.

668
01:01:28,750 --> 01:01:29,832
The girls are glad.

669
01:01:31,083 --> 01:01:34,999
l promise you that once
this school is built..

670
01:01:35,083 --> 01:01:38,915
..the girls won't have to leave
the village for higher studies.

671
01:01:40,250 --> 01:01:43,999
And one more thing, the
first brick for the school..

672
01:01:44,083 --> 01:01:49,165
..isn't going to be laid by Maati or
me, but will be laid by the girl..

673
01:01:49,250 --> 01:01:53,499
..because of whom this school is
being built. Ms. Zaara Hayaat Khan.

674
01:02:00,666 --> 01:02:07,665
Come, dear.

675
01:02:09,375 --> 01:02:12,499
Father, how can l..
- Why not?

676
01:02:13,208 --> 01:02:17,082
Being so young, you've
taught me such a big lesson..

677
01:02:17,583 --> 01:02:19,082
Then why can't you do
this little thing for me?

678
01:02:19,750 --> 01:02:20,832
Come, dear, come.

679
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,082
Oh, Kamli.

680
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:47,499
l, Ginda Singh. l really like you.

681
01:03:12,375 --> 01:03:14,999
Oh. l, Darshan Singh Aulakh..

682
01:03:15,083 --> 01:03:16,832
Will die for you.

683
01:03:26,916 --> 01:03:31,082
Maati, is this the custom of Lodi?
- No, this is Veer's father's custom.

684
01:03:32,291 --> 01:03:38,082
What do you mean?
- ln our time, romance was taboo.

685
01:03:38,666 --> 01:03:41,665
On top of that, l was from
Madras and he, from Punjab,

686
01:03:42,583 --> 01:03:46,249
So, one night, during Lodi, he asked
for my hand in front of everybody.

687
01:03:46,875 --> 01:03:50,249
My parents didn't know what
to say. And we got married.

688
01:03:51,083 --> 01:03:52,999
After that, eνer since we've come
here and started celebrating Lodi..

689
01:03:53,083 --> 01:03:58,165
..he's started this custom that
if a boy is in love with a girl..

690
01:03:58,250 --> 01:03:59,832
..he confesses his
love in front of everyone.

691
01:04:00,250 --> 01:04:01,999
lf the girl wants to refuse..

692
01:04:02,083 --> 01:04:04,582
..she quietly throws a
fistful of sesame into the fire.

693
01:04:04,916 --> 01:04:06,999
lf she wants to accept, she
calls out the boy's name..

694
01:04:07,083 --> 01:04:09,332
..and breaks sugar cane.

695
01:04:09,833 --> 01:04:11,665
Then after that we get them married.

696
01:04:12,041 --> 01:04:14,999
Wow, this is such a
lovely custom. That means..

697
01:04:15,083 --> 01:04:19,082
..when the bride and the groom agree,
what's the need of a priest.

698
01:04:19,541 --> 01:04:21,415
Hey, Saraswati Kaur.

699
01:04:25,291 --> 01:04:29,999
My lady from Madras. l,
Chaudhary Sumer Singh..

700
01:04:30,083 --> 01:04:32,999
..ask for your hand in marriage
for the next seven lifetimes.

701
01:04:41,625 --> 01:04:42,707
l've done it.

702
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,082
Come on, girl.

703
01:04:46,750 --> 01:04:47,832
l'll set him right.

704
01:04:49,333 --> 01:04:52,999
Let that be. Come on. Come on.

705
01:05:03,750 --> 01:05:06,165
What.. my proposal.. Rejected?

706
01:05:06,333 --> 01:05:12,082
Maati, what're you doing?
Father doesn't stand a chance?

707
01:05:12,541 --> 01:05:15,999
Tell him if he wants to
spend seven lifetimes with me..

708
01:05:16,083 --> 01:05:19,082
..he has to fulfil
certain promises. ls he ready?

709
01:05:19,166 --> 01:05:21,499
Promises? What promises, Maati?

710
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:25,165
Sorry, Father. that's it. Now,
drop the sugar cane.

711
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:29,165
Okay, l'll drop it.

712
01:05:30,916 --> 01:05:40,332


713
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:45,082
"l would sacrifice my life for you
if only l could know what you want."

714
01:05:45,250 --> 01:05:49,249
"l would agree to everything,
my beautiful one."

715
01:05:49,333 --> 01:05:54,749
"l would sacrifice my life for you
if only l could know what you want."

716
01:05:54,916 --> 01:05:58,749
"l would agree to everything,
my beautiful one."

717
01:05:58,833 --> 01:06:01,999
"l would sacrifice
my life for you."

718
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:06,999
"l know you very, νery well."

719
01:06:07,166 --> 01:06:11,999
"lf you want to be with me then,
you better fulfil what l ask of you."

720
01:06:12,166 --> 01:06:16,749
"l know you very, νery well."

721
01:06:16,916 --> 01:06:21,749
"lf you want to be with me then, you
better fulfil what l ask of you."

722
01:06:21,833 --> 01:06:27,582
"l know you very, νery well."

723
01:06:27,666 --> 01:06:30,082
"Hey, you are my life."

724
01:06:32,250 --> 01:06:34,832
"You are my beloved."

725
01:06:36,250 --> 01:06:38,749
"The festival of Lodi is here?"

726
01:06:38,833 --> 01:06:41,165
"Take your partners?"

727
01:06:41,250 --> 01:06:43,582
"Grasp the wrist of your beloved."

728
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:45,999
"And never let it go."

729
01:06:46,083 --> 01:06:48,457
"Never let it go."

730
01:06:48,541 --> 01:06:50,832
"Don't tell lies."

731
01:06:50,916 --> 01:06:53,249
"Don't be guilty of blasphemy?"

732
01:06:53,333 --> 01:06:57,749
"Every oath you swear,
has been broken by you."

733
01:06:57,833 --> 01:07:00,832
"Been broken by you"

734
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,999
"As soon as the sun
sets every evening..

735
01:07:06,083 --> 01:07:07,749
..you drink with your cronies."

736
01:07:07,833 --> 01:07:12,582
"The sun goes down and you get drunk.
What sort of life is this?"

737
01:07:16,416 --> 01:07:20,999
"You're perfectly right and
henceforth l shall keep it in mind."

738
01:07:21,166 --> 01:07:25,832
"Just let me drink today, from
tomorrow, l shall not touch a drop."

739
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:31,999
"Yes, now, he will come
straight home at sundown."

740
01:07:32,083 --> 01:07:36,207
"l would sacrifice my life for you."

741
01:07:36,291 --> 01:07:40,999
"My dear one, my fair one,
my handsome one, my beloved."

742
01:07:41,083 --> 01:07:45,915
"My life, oh, dear one.
Oh, beautiful one."

743
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:04,082
"Everyday, l see you playing cards.
More beloved than me.."

744
01:08:04,166 --> 01:08:09,665
"..are your fives,
sixes and sevens?"

745
01:08:09,750 --> 01:08:10,832
"Why?"

746
01:08:13,333 --> 01:08:18,082
"My card playing
foolishness will end forever."

747
01:08:18,250 --> 01:08:23,082
"Now, there will be only two cards
in my life, the king and the queen."

748
01:08:24,250 --> 01:08:28,915
"My life will be yours if you
give up these decks of cards."

749
01:08:29,166 --> 01:08:34,707
"l know you very, νery well."

750
01:08:34,791 --> 01:08:37,415
"Hey, you are my life."

751
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:42,082
"You are my beloved."

752
01:08:43,583 --> 01:08:45,999
"The festival of Lodi is here?

753
01:08:46,083 --> 01:08:48,415
"Take your partners?"

"Been broken by you."

761
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:22,082
"Whenever l ask you to bring
something, you can never remember."

762
01:09:22,416 --> 01:09:27,165
"l asked you for some ribbons
for my hair and you bought sweets."

763
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:35,499
"Now, l have this notebook
in which l will write.."

764
01:09:35,583 --> 01:09:40,415
"..so that l can bring
exactly what you ask me to get."

765
01:09:40,666 --> 01:09:46,415
"Yes, slowly, he will mend
his ways completely.. yes?"

"My beautiful one, my
innocent one, my life, my beloved."

768
01:09:55,500 --> 01:10:00,832
"My dear one, my fair one,
my handsome one, my beloved."

769
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:16,665
"Whether you change or you don't,
you will always be mine."

770
01:10:16,833 --> 01:10:21,749
"l want that in every
birth you should be mine."

771
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:33,749
"Beloved, in every birth,
l'm your worshipper."

772
01:10:33,833 --> 01:10:38,832
"You were mine, you are mine
and you will always be mine."

773
01:10:38,916 --> 01:10:44,582
"Yes, without you, he will be lost."

774
01:10:44,666 --> 01:10:50,915
"l would sacrifice my life for you."

775
01:11:08,916 --> 01:11:10,999
"lt's the season of Lodi."

776
01:11:11,083 --> 01:11:12,999
"Make pairings."

777
01:11:13,083 --> 01:11:17,082
"Grasp the wrist of your beloved,
and never let it go."

778
01:11:17,166 --> 01:11:19,165
"Do not lie."

779
01:11:19,250 --> 01:11:21,249
"Don't be guilty of blasphemy."

780
01:11:21,333 --> 01:11:25,665
"Every oath you swear,
has been broken by you."

781
01:11:40,750 --> 01:11:43,832
Father. Here you are, Father.

782
01:11:44,250 --> 01:11:46,082
God knows where all
Maati's sent me to look for you.

783
01:11:46,250 --> 01:11:48,665
Breakfast is getting cold. Come
quickly. l've got to leave. Come on.

784
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,415
Come here son. Sit.

785
01:11:56,208 --> 01:11:58,749
What happened, Father?
What're you looking at?

786
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:07,332
l'm looking at my lifetime's
achievements, my legacy, my village.

787
01:12:09,708 --> 01:12:11,999
Until now, l was very proud of
myself that l have done great work.

788
01:12:12,083 --> 01:12:15,165
That l've developed
this village from nothing.

789
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:18,999
But yesterday..

790
01:12:19,083 --> 01:12:23,165
..that young girl asked me an
innocent question. And l realised..

791
01:12:23,250 --> 01:12:28,832
..that l haven't done much..
there's still a lot left to do.

792
01:12:31,666 --> 01:12:34,749
Son, in the few years left of my
life, how much can l really achieve?

793
01:12:35,750 --> 01:12:37,499
And after l die, this
village will be orphaned.

794
01:12:38,291 --> 01:12:39,749
All the work will be
left incomplete.

795
01:12:42,750 --> 01:12:44,999
So, l was seeing a
dream and wondering..

796
01:12:45,083 --> 01:12:50,582
..if my dream will come true or not.
- What dream, Father?

797
01:12:55,000 --> 01:13:00,415
l saw that after Maati and l are
gone, you are here riding my bicycle.

798
01:13:01,166 --> 01:13:04,915
Your wife is sitting behind you.
The village is not orphaned.

799
01:13:05,250 --> 01:13:07,415
Nothing is left incomplete.
That's what l was seeing.

800
01:13:08,333 --> 01:13:09,832
So, why won't this dream come true?

801
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:17,082
Now that you've become
Squadron Leader Veer Pratap Singh..

802
01:13:17,166 --> 01:13:19,665
..you'll settle in the city. Why
would you worry about the village?

803
01:13:19,750 --> 01:13:22,165
No, Father. l am your
Veeru first and foremost.

804
01:13:22,666 --> 01:13:24,749
And if you've seen a
dream it will come true.

805
01:13:25,416 --> 01:13:26,749
Only l won't be
circling around on a cycle.

806
01:13:27,041 --> 01:13:30,999
l'll use a helicopter. Will
that do? Okay, come on now..

807
01:13:31,083 --> 01:13:35,082
Otherwise Maati's going to shout.
- Oh, there's one more thing.

808
01:13:38,833 --> 01:13:46,165
ln my dream, l've also seen the girl
sitting behind you on the cycle.

809
01:13:55,583 --> 01:13:57,499
Looks like you'νe already
had some rum this morning.

810
01:13:58,250 --> 01:14:00,499
Father she's a Pakistani

811
01:14:00,875 --> 01:14:04,082
She's Pakistani,
Chinese or Japanese.

812
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:08,082
l don't care. l can just see..

813
01:14:08,166 --> 01:14:14,249
..that when this girl sits
behind you on the cycle..

814
01:14:14,333 --> 01:14:19,415
..her hand will rest on your
shoulder, she'll never let you fall.

815
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:26,582
She'll never let you take a
wrong turn. Come here, sit. Listen..

816
01:14:26,666 --> 01:14:32,749
When the right woman
comes into a man's life..

817
01:14:32,833 --> 01:14:34,415
..that's when his
life becomes complete.

818
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:37,999
l Chaudhary Sumer
Singh am incomplete..

819
01:14:38,083 --> 01:14:45,165
..without your Maati. And you
Squadron Leader Veer Pratap Singh..

820
01:14:45,250 --> 01:14:48,249
..will be incomplete without Zaara.

821
01:14:49,083 --> 01:14:50,999
That's why, first, you understand..

822
01:14:51,083 --> 01:14:54,665
..what your heart is telling you,
and then quickly tell her.

823
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:57,332
Otherwise, son, it'll be too late.

824
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:03,582
Father, tell me one thing.
- Yes?

825
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:07,082
Since it's your dream, is
it okay if the wife sits..

826
01:15:07,166 --> 01:15:08,415
..on the front seat of the cycle?

827
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:10,165
Yes, it's okay.
Should l go tell her?

828
01:15:10,333 --> 01:15:11,999
No, please. Only l will tell her.
- No, no l'll tell her.

829
01:15:12,083 --> 01:15:16,415
No, l do the talking.
- She's downstairs? l'll tell her.

830
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:18,374
Who's marrying? You or l?
- One and the same.

831
01:15:18,458 --> 01:15:24,582
One and the same?
- Neνer mind. Hey, lucky girl.

832
01:15:33,458 --> 01:15:36,415
May l leave, Maati?
- Oh, are you leaving?

833
01:15:37,416 --> 01:15:38,999
l'll let you go only
on one condition.

834
01:15:39,083 --> 01:15:41,415
You have to promise to come back.

835
01:15:42,875 --> 01:15:43,999
Okay, l promise.

836
01:15:44,083 --> 01:15:48,165
But in return, will you give
me permission for something?

837
01:15:48,333 --> 01:15:49,415
What?

838
01:15:50,708 --> 01:15:51,999
Now onwards..

839
01:15:52,083 --> 01:15:54,332
..may l call you Bebe?

840
01:16:12,625 --> 01:16:13,915
l think we should leave.

841
01:16:14,750 --> 01:16:18,082
Or it'll get late.
- l'm ready. l'll go get my bag.

842
01:16:20,583 --> 01:16:23,082
You're leaving?
- Yes, Maati.

843
01:16:24,083 --> 01:16:27,582
You'd asked me to come here for
Lodi no matter what. So, l came.

844
01:16:28,916 --> 01:16:30,207
But l've got leave for only two days.

845
01:16:30,416 --> 01:16:32,082
l've to report at
headquarters tonight

846
01:16:32,375 --> 01:16:35,665
l'll put Zaara on a bus to
Amritsar and.. - Absolutely not.

847
01:16:36,333 --> 01:16:38,999
You'll take Zaara to Atari and see
her onto her train. She's all alone.

848
01:16:39,083 --> 01:16:41,082
What if something happens to her?

849
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,915
She's become your favourite
in a day?

850
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:49,332
You would get upset when it was
time for me to leave, and stop me.

851
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:51,165
Today, you want me
to leave quickly?

852
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,915
l don't have time
for your nonsense.

853
01:16:54,916 --> 01:16:57,999
l've made some sweets for
you and Ranjit. Take them

854
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:07,415
Oh, Ginda, where've you been?
- Veeru's getting late.

855
01:17:07,583 --> 01:17:09,999
Father, l was filling up diesel.
- ls this any time to fill up?

856
01:17:10,083 --> 01:17:11,332
Let it be.

857
01:17:12,416 --> 01:17:13,582
Okay, now, bless me.

858
01:17:13,666 --> 01:17:16,499
May you live long, son.

859
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,665
Tell her, okay?
- Yes, yes, l'll tell her.

860
01:17:19,750 --> 01:17:21,832
Shall l?
- Stop pressurising me.

861
01:17:21,916 --> 01:17:22,999
Maati, control him.

862
01:17:23,083 --> 01:17:24,582
Oh, where are you going?
What's in this?

863
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,332
Not for you.
- No? l see.

864
01:17:27,416 --> 01:17:29,915
For your son?
- Father.

865
01:17:32,083 --> 01:17:35,999
What are you doing? Here,
girls don't touch the feet.

866
01:17:36,458 --> 01:17:37,540
But daughters ask for blessings..

867
01:17:37,625 --> 01:17:39,582
..before they bid
farewell to their fathers.

868
01:17:41,833 --> 01:17:44,082
May you live long, my dear.

869
01:17:47,833 --> 01:17:51,082
Give your parents
a message from me.

870
01:17:51,166 --> 01:17:52,249
Okay.

871
01:17:53,416 --> 01:17:56,999
Tell them that
a 60-year-old lndian..

872
01:17:57,083 --> 01:18:00,665
..salutes the values
they've put into you.

873
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,249
Will we reach in an hour?
- lt will take about half hour.

874
01:18:33,666 --> 01:18:35,832
Look after yourselves.

875
01:18:36,916 --> 01:18:38,665
Goodbye.

876
01:18:45,750 --> 01:18:48,082
What do you think?
Will Veeru tell her?

877
01:18:48,916 --> 01:18:52,165
He's Chaudhary Sumer Singh's son,
why won't he tell her?

878
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,832
Didn't l tell you?

879
01:18:54,916 --> 01:18:58,999
Stop it.
- What.. where're you going? Listen..

880
01:19:08,708 --> 01:19:11,582
Squadron Leader Veer Pratap Singh,
thank you very much.

881
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,082
What for?

882
01:19:14,083 --> 01:19:15,999
ln exchange for my one day..

883
01:19:16,083 --> 01:19:21,082
..you've given me a lifetime
of memories and relationships.

884
01:19:21,833 --> 01:19:25,999
lt was a promise from an lndian to a
Pakistani. lf l didn't fulfil it..

885
01:19:26,083 --> 01:19:29,499
..my country's honour
would've been tarnished, right?

886
01:19:31,416 --> 01:19:35,082
l think getting Bebe's ashes
here was God's way to get me here.

887
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:40,665
l was destined to meet all of you.
- Do you believe in destiny?

888
01:19:41,750 --> 01:19:42,832
Of course.

889
01:19:43,666 --> 01:19:47,082
Don't you?
- Not until now.

890
01:19:48,583 --> 01:19:49,665
But now, l've begun to believe.

891
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,499
Are you all right?

892
01:20:02,791 --> 01:20:04,582
lt's all right now. Come on.

893
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,249
Oh..

894
01:20:09,833 --> 01:20:11,415
You aren't all right,
you're hurting?

895
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:16,165
Look, let's rest here for a while..
- No, l'll miss my train

896
01:20:16,666 --> 01:20:19,665
You won't miss your train.

897
01:20:20,625 --> 01:20:24,915
Lean on me. Put your hand across.

898
01:20:25,666 --> 01:20:28,915
Your anklet.

899
01:20:32,416 --> 01:20:33,999
l'll keep it. l'll
give it to you later.

900
01:20:34,708 --> 01:20:36,457
Come, hold on tight.

901
01:20:44,041 --> 01:20:45,915
How many times are you
going to save my life?

902
01:20:48,666 --> 01:20:50,415
As many times you
put yourself at risk.

903
01:21:35,333 --> 01:21:37,499
Actually, there's a
lot of hustle for seats.

904
01:21:38,291 --> 01:21:39,374
The festival of Eid is coming up.

905
01:21:39,458 --> 01:21:41,082
At this time, a lot of
people go across the border.

906
01:21:41,166 --> 01:21:43,832
But don't worry, l'll find a way.

907
01:21:44,416 --> 01:21:47,999
'The passengers are requested to..'

908
01:22:09,250 --> 01:22:15,749
Thank God you're all right. l
just got off the train from Lahore.

909
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:19,082
l was finding out about
Kiritpur when l saw you.

910
01:22:20,791 --> 01:22:23,999
Your father has returned.
He sent me.

911
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,582
Let's call home and
tell them you're fine.

912
01:22:27,750 --> 01:22:29,165
Then we'll prepare for our return.

913
01:22:32,833 --> 01:22:33,999
And you are..

914
01:22:34,333 --> 01:22:37,915
This is Veer. Squadron
Leader Veer Pratap Singh.

915
01:22:38,416 --> 01:22:40,249
Thanks to him, l'νe
managed to get here.

916
01:22:41,208 --> 01:22:44,082
This is Raza. Raza Shirazi,
my fiance.

917
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,999
'Passengers going to
Lahore are requested to..

918
01:23:12,083 --> 01:23:14,999
..before taking their
seats in the train.'

919
01:23:15,083 --> 01:23:18,582
'We wish you a happy journey.
Thank you.'

920
01:23:19,250 --> 01:23:21,582
The seats are done, we
should be leaving now.

921
01:23:24,416 --> 01:23:27,999
So silly of me. l kept
talking about eνerything..

922
01:23:28,083 --> 01:23:32,999
..but l forgot to tell you about
Raza. - You made a big mistake.

923
01:23:33,750 --> 01:23:34,832
What?

924
01:23:38,916 --> 01:23:40,082
You made a big mistake.

925
01:23:47,375 --> 01:23:50,915
Zaara, l'm a very simple man.

926
01:23:52,250 --> 01:23:54,915
l speak frankly and
understand things simply.

927
01:23:56,333 --> 01:23:57,999
lt's the first time
l started thinking..

928
01:23:58,083 --> 01:24:00,499
..differently because
of father and Maati.

929
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,082
The entire journey l kept thinking..

930
01:24:04,166 --> 01:24:07,249
..up a way to stop you,
not to let you go..

931
01:24:07,333 --> 01:24:12,415
..and tell you that l really like
you and if you think l'm okay then..

932
01:24:12,500 --> 01:24:18,415
..let's get married.

933
01:24:21,416 --> 01:24:22,999
And we'll breeze through
life together just like..

934
01:24:23,083 --> 01:24:24,999
..these past two days.

935
01:24:27,291 --> 01:24:28,665
But the guy up there
has strange ways.

936
01:24:29,708 --> 01:24:32,999
He kept building my confidence
and then when we got here..

937
01:24:34,375 --> 01:24:36,499
He changed the entire story.

938
01:24:43,750 --> 01:24:48,249
You must be wondering why l'm
telling you all this right now.

939
01:24:48,416 --> 01:24:50,915
Please don't get me wrong.

940
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:57,082
l understand that you
belong to someone else..

941
01:24:57,166 --> 01:25:04,249
..and there's nothing
between us, nor can there ever be.

942
01:25:04,333 --> 01:25:11,415
But wherever
whenever you need a friend..

943
01:25:11,500 --> 01:25:15,582
..just remember that there
is a man across the border..

944
01:25:15,666 --> 01:25:19,832
..who will give his life for you.

945
01:25:28,375 --> 01:25:29,582
Zaara, we must leave.

946
01:25:30,833 --> 01:25:31,999
Mr. Veer.

947
01:25:32,083 --> 01:25:36,082
Zaara told me how you
saved her life.

948
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:38,165
Now, l'm indebted to you.

949
01:25:39,041 --> 01:25:41,999
So, tell me how may l repay you?
- Just keep Zaara happy.

950
01:25:42,083 --> 01:25:46,165
The debt will be repaid.

951
01:25:46,750 --> 01:25:48,999
Careful, Mr Veer..

952
01:25:49,083 --> 01:25:52,749
..lest l get the impression that
you've fallen in love with Zaara.

953
01:25:55,541 --> 01:25:58,665
What is love..
l don't know. But yes.

954
01:26:00,458 --> 01:26:02,999
l do wish from the
bottom of my heart..

955
01:26:03,083 --> 01:26:06,165
..that Zaara never
has tears in her eyes.

956
01:26:07,083 --> 01:26:08,415
That she always keeps smiling.

957
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:14,582
lf that's what you call loνe,
then love it is.

958
01:26:16,541 --> 01:26:23,832
Mr. Veer, you're talking
about my fiancee to my face.

959
01:26:25,625 --> 01:26:30,665
l don't know whether to consider
this a compliment or an insult.

960
01:26:32,833 --> 01:26:36,499
lf you think of this as nothing,
it's better. For the truth is that..

961
01:26:37,833 --> 01:26:42,915
..l'm nothing to her and
you are everything for her.

962
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:51,082
Goodbye.

963
01:26:52,333 --> 01:26:53,415
Let's go.

964
01:27:04,041 --> 01:27:14,040


965
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:31,082
"Just for two moments, the
caravans of our dreams made a stop."

966
01:27:31,250 --> 01:27:36,749
"And then, you went
your way and l went mine."

967
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:42,665
"Just for two moments,
existed the story of our hearts."

968
01:27:42,750 --> 01:27:55,082
"And then you went
your way and l went mine."

969
01:28:14,625 --> 01:28:19,582
"Was that really you or
was it a luminous sunbeam?"

970
01:28:19,666 --> 01:28:25,999
"Was that you or was
it a blossoming bud?"

971
01:28:26,083 --> 01:28:31,165
"Was that you or was that
the monsoon of my dreams?"

972
01:28:31,250 --> 01:28:36,915
"Was that you or was
that a cloud of happiness?"

973
01:28:37,416 --> 01:28:42,499
"Was that you or was it
a full blooming flower?"

974
01:28:42,583 --> 01:28:48,832
"Was that you or did l
find a beautiful new world?"

975
01:28:48,916 --> 01:28:53,915
"Just for two moments, the
caravans of our dreams made a stop."

976
01:28:54,083 --> 01:29:00,082
"And then you went
your way and l went mine."

977
01:29:00,416 --> 01:29:05,415
"Just for two moments,
existed the story of our hearts."

978
01:29:05,500 --> 01:29:12,832
"And then you went
your way and l went mine."

979
01:29:23,166 --> 01:29:24,749
786.

980
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:30,082
Dinner time.

981
01:29:32,791 --> 01:29:36,582
And ma'am, your visiting
time is over.

982
01:29:37,125 --> 01:29:38,582
You'll have to leave now.

983
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:51,082
l'll come back tomorrow.

984
01:29:52,666 --> 01:29:55,915
Sorry, your story is
left incomplete.

985
01:29:56,625 --> 01:29:57,707
Come on, ma'am.

986
01:30:10,458 --> 01:30:11,999
And 786..

987
01:30:12,083 --> 01:30:13,999
..l'm sending someone to
take the plate in ten minutes.

988
01:30:14,166 --> 01:30:17,499
Eat quickly, or you'll have to
sleep on an empty stomach again.

989
01:30:20,083 --> 01:30:24,999
Have you ever wondered
why his number is 786?

990
01:30:25,333 --> 01:30:26,415
What?

991
01:30:27,833 --> 01:30:32,999
Have you ever wondered.. From
the thousands of prisoners here..

992
01:30:33,083 --> 01:30:39,082
..how come this lone Hindu prisoner
has got Allah's holy number?

993
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:46,999
This is not a mere coincidence,
this is God's great miracle.

994
01:30:48,416 --> 01:30:54,665
His way of telling all of
you that this is God's own man.

995
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:57,082
Treat him with respect.

996
01:30:59,416 --> 01:31:01,999
Next time, you speak
to him so rudely..

997
01:31:02,083 --> 01:31:04,665
..give a serious thought
to what l've just said.

998
01:32:09,958 --> 01:32:13,624
These are sweets.
My mother sent them for you.

999
01:32:16,875 --> 01:32:20,374
Please have some. She has
sent them with her blessings.

1000
01:32:31,958 --> 01:32:34,707
What happened? You don't like it?

1001
01:32:36,208 --> 01:32:44,457
No.. no.. these are just
like the ones Maati would make.

1002
01:32:46,875 --> 01:32:50,290
Things made by a mother's
hands are the same everywhere.

1003
01:32:51,625 --> 01:32:54,707
May l have one more?

1004
01:32:55,416 --> 01:32:57,374
Yes, please. These are all for you.

1005
01:33:01,291 --> 01:33:05,207
Tell your mother she's
filled my entire childhood..

1006
01:33:05,291 --> 01:33:09,124
..into this little box.

1007
01:33:10,625 --> 01:33:11,707
Delicious.

1008
01:33:14,958 --> 01:33:17,540
All night, l was
telling my mother your story.

1009
01:33:19,375 --> 01:33:21,124
My mother cried a
little and went to sleep.

1010
01:33:22,208 --> 01:33:24,124
But l stayed up waiting for dawn.

1011
01:33:25,458 --> 01:33:29,457
l kept thinking how
and why did you get here?

1012
01:33:30,833 --> 01:33:35,124
Kept wondering why didn't
this story end at that station?

1013
01:33:38,458 --> 01:33:42,457
This story couldn't
haνe ended there.

1014
01:33:44,791 --> 01:33:49,790
Because so far, this was
only a tale of Veer's love.

1015
01:33:51,875 --> 01:33:55,624
Zaara's love had not yet begun.

1016
01:33:57,958 --> 01:34:05,207
And without knowing what Zaara felt,
Veer's story and Veer's life..

1017
01:34:05,291 --> 01:34:12,207
..would both remain incomplete.

1018
01:34:17,125 --> 01:34:21,790
Jehangir Hayaat Khan, Zaara's
father and the pride of Lahore.

1019
01:34:24,125 --> 01:34:29,290
Since the inception of Pakistan
the name of the Hayaat Khan family..

1020
01:34:30,125 --> 01:34:34,290
..was synonymous with respect,
power and glory.

1021
01:34:37,833 --> 01:34:42,124
Jehangir Hayaat Khan was taking
his first step into politics..

1022
01:34:43,125 --> 01:34:46,457
..with the help of Abdul Shirazi.

1023
01:34:49,208 --> 01:34:52,207
Another rich,
respectable man of Lahore.

1024
01:34:52,291 --> 01:34:55,540
He was Raza Shirazi's father.

1025
01:34:58,500 --> 01:35:02,207
Zaara and Raza's marriage
was no ordinary relationship.

1026
01:35:03,291 --> 01:35:06,707
All these people's futures
were dependent on this alliance.

1027
01:35:08,125 --> 01:35:09,207
ln this situation..

1028
01:35:09,291 --> 01:35:12,207
Zaara's coming to lndia all
by herself was..

1029
01:35:12,291 --> 01:35:13,707
..a νery irresponsible act.

1030
01:35:14,708 --> 01:35:19,957
And to forgive such an act was
not Jehangir Hayaat Khan's nature.

1031
01:35:21,375 --> 01:35:25,207
lt was a month since
Zaara had returned..

1032
01:35:25,291 --> 01:35:28,207
..but her father had
not yet spoken with her.

1033
01:35:29,125 --> 01:35:31,207
Oh, God. Ma'am, l'll burst with
happiness what an elegant outfit..

1034
01:35:31,291 --> 01:35:37,374
..and look. l think this
jewellery set is an antique.

1035
01:35:37,458 --> 01:35:39,290
l think it belongs to
Mr. Raza's ancestors.

1036
01:35:39,916 --> 01:35:46,124
Our Zaara is very lucky. Mr Raza has
everything. Respectability, money.

1037
01:35:46,208 --> 01:35:50,707
There's no doubt in that.
He has everything by God's grace.

1038
01:35:51,125 --> 01:35:54,290
There could not be a better
match than this. Just pray for them.

1039
01:35:54,416 --> 01:35:58,957
"There's a man across the border
who will give his life for you."

1040
01:36:00,291 --> 01:36:05,040
Mother, can you give
up your life for papa?

1041
01:36:06,708 --> 01:36:10,040
Of course. He's my husband.
l can do anything for him

1042
01:36:10,791 --> 01:36:13,290
And would papa give
up his life for you?

1043
01:36:14,458 --> 01:36:16,207
What kind of a question
is that. Pray to God..

1044
01:36:16,291 --> 01:36:17,874
..that such an
occasion does not arise.

1045
01:36:19,791 --> 01:36:21,707
But if such an occasion
were to arise?

1046
01:36:22,791 --> 01:36:26,540
Then can you say for sure that
papa would give up his life for you?

1047
01:36:26,916 --> 01:36:28,124
Have you gone mad?

1048
01:36:28,541 --> 01:36:31,457
Shabbo, give me some lime.
My hands have become sticky.

1049
01:36:31,583 --> 01:36:35,624
That means you're not sure?

1050
01:36:40,541 --> 01:36:44,207
Listen, baby, between
a woman's love..

1051
01:36:44,291 --> 01:36:47,374
..and a man's love,
there's a huge difference.

1052
01:36:49,541 --> 01:36:54,540
A woman loves with
all her heart and soul.

1053
01:36:55,541 --> 01:36:58,624
Men do not have the
strength to love like that.

1054
01:37:00,541 --> 01:37:03,707
l know why you're
asking me this question.

1055
01:37:04,625 --> 01:37:07,290
But don't expect this from Raza.

1056
01:37:09,208 --> 01:37:13,707
Just give him your heart and
soul and fulfil your duties.

1057
01:37:14,541 --> 01:37:18,374
And l am very sure, that he
will fulfil his duties too.

1058
01:37:21,041 --> 01:37:22,874
But he won't giνe up his
life for me, isn't it?

1059
01:37:23,625 --> 01:37:25,124
You're talking nonsense.

1060
01:37:25,208 --> 01:37:28,207
Here, Shabbo, you put it. This
girl is going to drive me mad.

1061
01:37:28,291 --> 01:37:32,790
"There's a man across the border
who will give his life for you."

1062
01:37:34,125 --> 01:37:40,290
But l know someone who will
willingly give up his life for me.

1063
01:37:45,541 --> 01:37:51,207
A person whose eyes are honest
and whose words have honour.

1064
01:37:51,291 --> 01:37:57,207
A man who can forsake
everything for a woman's love.

1065
01:37:57,291 --> 01:38:04,207
A person to whom it
makes no difference that..

1066
01:38:04,291 --> 01:38:10,374
..l'm a Pakistani and
he's an lndian.

1067
01:38:13,791 --> 01:38:17,624
Who're you talking about?
What've you been up to?

1068
01:38:18,208 --> 01:38:20,124
Tell me the truth. Swear on me.

1069
01:38:21,791 --> 01:38:23,207
He hasn't even touched me, Mother.

1070
01:38:23,291 --> 01:38:27,124
But l have lost my
heart and soul to him.

1071
01:38:28,125 --> 01:38:33,124
Don't you know your father?
Till now, he's not talking to you.

1072
01:38:33,291 --> 01:38:37,624
lf he finds out about this,
he'll kill you. Don't you realise?

1073
01:38:37,708 --> 01:38:40,874
You're getting engaged today.
You're going to be married soon.

1074
01:38:41,625 --> 01:38:44,124
Now, it's wrong to think
of anything else, Zaara.

1075
01:38:45,208 --> 01:38:51,540
Oh, stupid girl, love is only found
in books, and poetry. Not in life.

1076
01:38:54,041 --> 01:38:58,374
That's what l thought
until now.. until now..

1077
01:38:58,708 --> 01:38:59,790
'Listen.'

1078
01:39:02,125 --> 01:39:04,207
Shabbo, please put
some sense into her.

1079
01:39:04,291 --> 01:39:06,624
Otherwise a storm will
hit this house.

1080
01:39:09,875 --> 01:39:14,457
Just understand one thing,
Zaara. Your future is with Raza.

1081
01:39:14,958 --> 01:39:18,790
Now, neither you can
change this, nor God.

1082
01:39:21,291 --> 01:39:23,290
What's all this, Zaara?

1083
01:39:25,958 --> 01:39:27,124
lt's love, Shabbo.

1084
01:39:29,375 --> 01:39:30,957
lt doesn't come with reason.

1085
01:39:31,625 --> 01:39:35,707


1086
01:39:35,875 --> 01:39:43,124
"Pearl millet. We
crushed it in our palms."

1087
01:39:43,208 --> 01:39:45,457
"Pearl millet."

1088
01:39:45,625 --> 01:39:52,707
We crushed pearl millet in our
palms. My beloved is angry."

1089
01:39:52,958 --> 01:39:57,707
"My beloved is angry.
l sent him away."

1090
01:39:57,791 --> 01:40:00,207
"Pearl millet."

1091
01:40:04,958 --> 01:40:09,707
"The day that l will
forget you will never come."

1092
01:40:09,916 --> 01:40:15,790
"You had fallen for my beauty."

1093
01:40:15,875 --> 01:40:17,207
When he used to look into my eyes.

1094
01:40:17,291 --> 01:40:18,374
Wow. - He used to show
a lot of respect."

1095
01:40:18,458 --> 01:40:19,540
"Wow!"

1096
01:40:22,458 --> 01:40:23,540
Sit.

1097
01:40:27,833 --> 01:40:36,124
Since you're my only child,
l've given you a lot of freedom.

1098
01:40:38,208 --> 01:40:41,624
You've been brought up more
like a son than a daughter.

1099
01:40:43,875 --> 01:40:46,957
Normally, a mother explains
a daughter's duties to her.

1100
01:40:48,541 --> 01:40:54,540
But since l think of you as my son,
l shall myself do the honours.

1101
01:40:59,333 --> 01:41:01,207
You're aware..

1102
01:41:01,291 --> 01:41:03,207
..that your
grandfather was one of the..

1103
01:41:03,291 --> 01:41:04,457
..most respected
politicians of Pakistan.

1104
01:41:05,875 --> 01:41:08,207
But he died just a few
days before he could reach..

1105
01:41:08,291 --> 01:41:09,624
..the pinnacle of his success.

1106
01:41:12,125 --> 01:41:13,207
Ever since..

1107
01:41:13,291 --> 01:41:19,207
..being his successor,
l've been trying to..

1108
01:41:19,291 --> 01:41:21,957
..get his party to that same level.

1109
01:41:24,291 --> 01:41:29,207
l've been unsuccessful so far.
But now thanks to Raza's father..

1110
01:41:29,291 --> 01:41:32,124
..success seems near.

1111
01:41:34,875 --> 01:41:36,207
ln a few days, you'll be
going to their house..

1112
01:41:36,291 --> 01:41:37,790
..taking my honour with you.

1113
01:41:40,208 --> 01:41:44,207
lt's your duty to understand
the sensitiνity of this bond.

1114
01:41:44,291 --> 01:41:48,207
To spread happiness
in good times and bad.

1115
01:41:48,291 --> 01:41:55,874
To strengthen the bonds
of every relationship.

1116
01:41:57,125 --> 01:42:01,290
And no matter what, safeguard
their honour as well as ours.

1117
01:42:03,041 --> 01:42:07,624
Any small mistake on your
part can destroy everything.

1118
01:42:10,708 --> 01:42:13,207
l hope you understand
what l'm saying.

1119
01:42:14,500 --> 01:42:15,582
Yes.

1120
01:42:16,625 --> 01:42:18,040
Do you have anything to say?

1121
01:42:23,708 --> 01:42:25,290
Then would you please come here?

1122
01:42:31,041 --> 01:42:34,874
lt's been a long time since l've
seen the dimples of your cheeks.

1123
01:42:37,375 --> 01:42:39,624
l hope you haven't left
them in lndia.

1124
01:42:42,958 --> 01:42:44,040
That's my girl.

1125
01:42:48,625 --> 01:42:55,957


1126
01:42:56,125 --> 01:42:59,957
"Dearest behold.."

1127
01:43:00,208 --> 01:43:04,874
"The distances have gone."

1128
01:43:07,125 --> 01:43:19,124
"l am here, here, here and here."

1129
01:43:49,041 --> 01:43:54,290
"Dearest behold.
The distances have gone."

1130
01:43:54,500 --> 01:43:59,874
"l am here, here, here and here."

1131
01:44:00,208 --> 01:44:05,540
"Dearest behold.
The distances have gone."

1132
01:44:05,708 --> 01:44:11,040
"l am here, here, here and here."

1133
01:44:11,500 --> 01:44:16,790
"Beyond all borders and
encumbrances."

1134
01:44:16,916 --> 01:44:23,124
"l am here, here, here and here."

1135
01:44:47,541 --> 01:44:52,874
"l am the secret you
can never hide."

1136
01:44:53,208 --> 01:44:58,790
"l am the gesture
you can never forget."

1137
01:45:04,208 --> 01:45:09,874
"Why are you surprised
at these vibrations?"

1138
01:45:09,958 --> 01:45:15,124
"Because l am the
sound of your heart."

1139
01:45:15,541 --> 01:45:20,790
"Listen, if you can to
the rhythms of your heart."

1140
01:45:21,041 --> 01:45:26,374
"l'm here, here, here and here."

1141
01:45:26,708 --> 01:45:32,124
"Beyond all borders
and encumbrances."

1142
01:45:32,208 --> 01:45:38,207
"l am here, here, here and here."

1143
01:46:14,041 --> 01:46:19,290
"l and only l am now
in your thoughts."

1144
01:46:19,708 --> 01:46:25,207
"l am in all your
questions and your answers."

1145
01:46:30,708 --> 01:46:36,124
"l occupy all our dreams."

1146
01:46:36,208 --> 01:46:41,707
"l am in the radiance
of your sight."

1147
01:46:41,958 --> 01:46:47,457
"You can see me
wherever your vision goes."

1148
01:46:47,625 --> 01:46:53,040
"l'm here, here, here and here."

1149
01:46:53,208 --> 01:46:55,790
"Dearest behold.."

1150
01:46:55,916 --> 01:46:58,624
"The distances have gone."

1151
01:46:58,791 --> 01:47:04,124
"l am here, here, here and here."

1152
01:47:04,375 --> 01:47:09,874
"Beyond all borders
and encumbrances."

1153
01:47:09,958 --> 01:47:16,207
"l am here, here, here and here."

1154
01:47:31,666 --> 01:47:37,207
"l am here, here.."

1155
01:47:37,291 --> 01:47:44,290
"..here and here."

1156
01:47:44,625 --> 01:47:46,790
Zaara.
- Shabbo.

1157
01:47:48,875 --> 01:47:52,707
Tell him to get out of my sight.
l see him eνerywhere.

1158
01:47:53,833 --> 01:47:56,874
He's embedded in my soul, Shabbo.
Ask him to leaνe.

1159
01:47:57,208 --> 01:47:59,957
Please tell him,
Shabbo. Please tell him.

1160
01:48:00,208 --> 01:48:07,207
Please tell him, Shabbo.

1161
01:48:16,041 --> 01:48:18,124
Yes, Squadron Leader
Veer Pratap Singh.

1162
01:48:18,541 --> 01:48:24,290
Hello, Captain Veer Singh?
l'm Shabbo speaking.

1163
01:48:25,500 --> 01:48:29,040
Shabbo? l'm sorry.
l can't place you.

1164
01:48:33,333 --> 01:48:35,957
l'm calling from Zaara's house.

1165
01:48:42,125 --> 01:48:46,207
An unknown girl who l'd never
met before, was giving me..

1166
01:48:46,291 --> 01:48:53,624
..the biggest news of my life.
She very simply told me that..

1167
01:48:54,541 --> 01:48:59,124
..Zaara was in love with you
and she's about to get married.

1168
01:48:59,625 --> 01:49:02,957
Come to Lahore, take Zaara away.

1169
01:49:03,708 --> 01:49:05,790
She'll never be able to
take this step all by herself.

1170
01:49:07,291 --> 01:49:10,124
She says that you can
give your life for her.

1171
01:49:11,375 --> 01:49:13,624
And then she asked
me one last question.

1172
01:49:16,208 --> 01:49:25,040
How much do you love Zaara?

1173
01:49:27,125 --> 01:49:30,290
l didn't have an answer
to that question then.

1174
01:49:31,208 --> 01:49:32,374
Neither do l have one now.

1175
01:49:34,541 --> 01:49:36,707
How much do l love Zaara?

1176
01:49:39,125 --> 01:49:40,207
l don't know.

1177
01:49:41,291 --> 01:49:42,374
l know.

1178
01:49:46,291 --> 01:49:51,040
An lndian Air Force Pilot is not
permitted to come to Pakistan.

1179
01:49:53,208 --> 01:49:58,207
So, l know that the
minute you got this news..

1180
01:49:58,291 --> 01:50:01,207
..you resigned knowing
fully well that you will..

1181
01:50:01,291 --> 01:50:03,540
..never be able to rejoin.

1182
01:50:05,791 --> 01:50:11,207
Then without telling
anyone you left for Lahore.

1183
01:50:11,291 --> 01:50:18,290
Not knowing the outcome of the
journey. Would you reach in time?

1184
01:50:19,791 --> 01:50:25,290
Would you meet Zaara?
Would Zaara come back with you?

1185
01:50:26,958 --> 01:50:32,790
Or would you yourself be able to
return.. you didn't know anything.

1186
01:50:34,958 --> 01:50:36,374
But you still left.

1187
01:50:39,208 --> 01:50:42,957
Perhaps, you don't know,
but l know..

1188
01:50:44,416 --> 01:50:48,374
..how much you love Zaara. l know.

1189
01:51:13,708 --> 01:51:16,874
Welcome, sir. l'm Shabbo.

1190
01:51:32,125 --> 01:51:35,540
l'm sorry, l couldn't arrange
for anything better than this.

1191
01:51:41,291 --> 01:51:44,457
Wow, you can see the
entire city from here.

1192
01:51:47,625 --> 01:51:50,707
There can't be a better room
than this in the whole of Lahore.

1193
01:51:53,625 --> 01:51:56,124
l didn't tell Zaara
that you're coming.

1194
01:52:00,791 --> 01:52:02,624
l was scared that she would stop me.

1195
01:52:03,791 --> 01:52:07,707
Day after tomorrow is her wedding.
She can't come out of her house.

1196
01:52:08,791 --> 01:52:10,624
But tomorrow, she'll be going
to the shrine with everyone.

1197
01:52:12,291 --> 01:52:17,124
This is Munir, my younger brother.
He'll bring you to the shrine.

1198
01:52:18,333 --> 01:52:19,624
Then we'll leave it to God.

1199
01:52:20,791 --> 01:52:23,624
So, Munir, my fate
is in your hands now.

1200
01:52:26,041 --> 01:52:28,124
Well, l'll leave.

1201
01:52:28,791 --> 01:52:29,874
Leaving?

1202
01:52:30,375 --> 01:52:32,207
l got to leave,
if l'm away for long..

1203
01:52:32,291 --> 01:52:33,957
..they'll start wondering
where l am.

1204
01:52:34,541 --> 01:52:36,540
lf you need anything,
Munir's here.

1205
01:52:40,125 --> 01:52:41,207
Thank you, Shabbo.

1206
01:52:44,625 --> 01:52:49,790
l didn't think you'd come,
but now, after meeting you..

1207
01:52:51,041 --> 01:52:55,040
..l'm sure you'll take
Zaara with you.

1208
01:52:56,958 --> 01:52:58,040
How could l not come?

1209
01:52:58,708 --> 01:53:03,540
My father says, "True love
happens only once in a lifetime."

1210
01:53:04,375 --> 01:53:10,207
"And when it does, no God or
Allah can come in its way."

1211
01:53:12,208 --> 01:53:18,540
Tomorrow, we'll know how
true my love is in Allah's eyes.

1212
01:53:18,958 --> 01:53:26,624
"l have broken all the
barriers of society."

1213
01:53:26,708 --> 01:53:37,040
"l have left the
world and come to you."

1214
01:53:37,625 --> 01:53:47,374
"A besotted lover
has come to your door."

1215
01:53:47,500 --> 01:53:52,207
"Has come, has come.."
- "A besotted loνer has come."

1216
01:53:52,291 --> 01:54:01,707
"A besotted lover
has come to your door."

1217
01:54:02,125 --> 01:54:07,207
"Besotted by you, besotted
by you, besotted by you.."

1218
01:54:07,291 --> 01:54:15,290
"A besotted lover
has come to your door."

1219
01:54:15,375 --> 01:54:19,207
"He is completely devoted to you."

1220
01:54:19,291 --> 01:54:24,540
"He is completely obsessed by you."

1221
01:54:24,625 --> 01:54:29,124
"He will die for your love."

1222
01:54:29,208 --> 01:54:38,624
"A besotted lover
has come to your door."

1223
01:54:39,625 --> 01:54:49,624


1224
01:54:54,125 --> 01:54:57,207
"lf l see your face.."

1225
01:54:57,291 --> 01:55:03,040
"l will forget all my sorrows."

1226
01:55:03,333 --> 01:55:07,707
"These tears that are flowing,
this is all they are saying."

1227
01:55:07,958 --> 01:55:12,374
"You are beyond where l am,
but l have come here."

1228
01:55:12,625 --> 01:55:29,374
"lf l could have one favour,
just a glance from your eyes.."

1229
01:55:29,708 --> 01:55:38,874
"l would give my breath and heart.
l would give my entire life."

1230
01:55:38,958 --> 01:55:43,290
"Like the moth dies on the flame.."

1231
01:55:43,458 --> 01:56:15,290
"A besotted lover
has come to your door."

1232
01:56:15,625 --> 01:56:21,290
"A besotted lover.
A besotted lover."

1233
01:56:21,625 --> 01:56:25,290
"A besotted lover."

1234
01:56:31,875 --> 01:56:37,874
"A besotted lover.
A besotted lover."

1235
01:56:38,041 --> 01:56:41,624
"Besotted. Besotted."

1236
01:56:41,958 --> 01:56:48,207
"Your love story has
reached a critical juncture.

1237
01:56:48,291 --> 01:56:54,124
She has to sacrifice
herself in your love."

1238
01:56:54,208 --> 01:57:09,124
"Your love story has
reached a critical juncture."

1239
01:57:30,333 --> 01:57:32,540
He's conscious, but
he doesn't want to be.

1240
01:57:33,708 --> 01:57:36,374
He's listening to everything,
but he doesn't want to hear.

1241
01:57:37,916 --> 01:57:44,540
He's festering the shock deep
within as if he's punishing himself.

1242
01:57:47,291 --> 01:57:49,457
The next 24 hours are very critical.

1243
01:57:50,625 --> 01:57:53,374
He may not be able
to take another shock.

1244
01:57:55,541 --> 01:57:59,624
The nurse is here and l will keep
coming every three or four hours.

1245
01:58:01,708 --> 01:58:03,040
Goodbye.

1246
01:58:12,291 --> 01:58:16,374
Don't worry, Sister-in-law.
They were all our own people.

1247
01:58:17,208 --> 01:58:19,790
Thank Allah that the news
hasn't spread in the city.

1248
01:58:20,875 --> 01:58:24,374
Anyway, tomorrow, after the wedding,
all the wagging tongues will stop.

1249
01:58:25,208 --> 01:58:29,790
After all that's happened,
Raza's still ready to get married?

1250
01:58:30,041 --> 01:58:33,790
Mariam ma'am, this marriage is
not only between Raza and Zaara.

1251
01:58:34,666 --> 01:58:36,207
There's a very deep and a serious..

1252
01:58:36,291 --> 01:58:39,207
..pact behind it. lt's
on this foundation..

1253
01:58:39,291 --> 01:58:45,457
..that your husband's and
after him Raza's career rests.

1254
01:58:47,541 --> 01:58:53,874
Raza is very well aware of this.
Now, Zaara has to understand this..

1255
01:58:55,041 --> 01:58:58,207
lf this wedding doesn't
take place tomorrow then..

1256
01:58:58,291 --> 01:59:02,207
..Jehangir Hayaat Khan's
daughter's name will be..

1257
01:59:02,291 --> 01:59:05,040
..linked to an lndian man forever.

1258
01:59:06,791 --> 01:59:09,124
Mr. Khan's years of
hard work will be ruined.

1259
01:59:10,041 --> 01:59:14,207
He'd lose the elections
for sure, and he'll face..

1260
01:59:14,291 --> 01:59:15,957
..a lifetime of disgrace.

1261
01:59:17,458 --> 01:59:21,207
He will not be able to bear..

1262
01:59:21,291 --> 01:59:25,040
..the weight of that shame.

1263
01:59:26,625 --> 01:59:28,207
He won't be able to bear it.

1264
01:59:37,208 --> 01:59:39,624
Prepare for the wedding,
Brother Abdul

1265
01:59:41,208 --> 01:59:45,374
Tomorrow, there will be
a wedding in this house.

1266
01:59:57,875 --> 01:59:58,957
Where're you going?

1267
02:00:01,041 --> 02:00:02,124
To Zaara's house.

1268
02:00:02,791 --> 02:00:05,624
Please don't go anywhere.
Let tonight pass.

1269
02:00:06,291 --> 02:00:10,624
Raza is looking for you everywhere.
The house is completely silent.

1270
02:00:11,041 --> 02:00:15,124
You can't go there and do anything.
Abba is in deep shock.

1271
02:00:15,291 --> 02:00:18,707
l am the cause for the
shock and the solution.

1272
02:00:20,625 --> 02:00:22,957
l hadn't come here
just to see Zaara's face.

1273
02:00:24,958 --> 02:00:28,540
lf nobody speaks,
there's bound to be silence.

1274
02:00:30,666 --> 02:00:32,540
Someone has to make the first move.

1275
02:00:34,958 --> 02:00:38,124
Whether it brings on
a storm or a wedding.

1276
02:01:38,916 --> 02:01:45,290
My name is Mariam Hayaat Khan.
l'm Zaara's mother.

1277
02:01:46,916 --> 02:01:52,207
But perhaps, today, l have
lost the right to call her my own.

1278
02:01:54,125 --> 02:01:56,207
Because my
daughter's not mine anymore.

1279
02:01:57,666 --> 02:02:01,374
She's yours now.

1280
02:02:05,208 --> 02:02:07,457
l've come to ask you to
give my daughter back to me.

1281
02:02:09,125 --> 02:02:14,957
Please give us back our daughter.
Otherwise, her father will die.

1282
02:02:20,541 --> 02:02:25,374
He won't be able to
bear the shame, he'll die.

1283
02:02:29,208 --> 02:02:33,457
l've heard that you save lives.

1284
02:02:36,208 --> 02:02:38,374
You're the one who
saved Zaara's life.

1285
02:02:40,833 --> 02:02:45,374
So, now, please save
her father's life.

1286
02:02:48,208 --> 02:02:53,790
l beg of you, please save his life.

1287
02:02:56,625 --> 02:02:58,124
Otherwise, he'll die.

1288
02:03:01,208 --> 02:03:02,707
He'll die.

1289
02:03:06,291 --> 02:03:11,374
A mother never has to beg to
her son. She just has to order.

1290
02:03:15,541 --> 02:03:19,790
Zaara has always and
will always belong to you.

1291
02:03:24,208 --> 02:03:29,124
Did you think that l would've taken
Zaara away without your permission?

1292
02:03:33,208 --> 02:03:35,207
People say that love is blind..

1293
02:03:35,291 --> 02:03:41,874
..so, we too were
blinded by our love.

1294
02:03:43,375 --> 02:03:44,790
We could only see each other.

1295
02:03:46,291 --> 02:03:48,790
We didn't see if we
were harming anyone.

1296
02:03:50,291 --> 02:03:52,707
Hurting anyone or..

1297
02:03:54,791 --> 02:03:56,457
..if someone's life was at stake.

1298
02:03:58,791 --> 02:04:00,040
We couldn't see anything.

1299
02:04:02,833 --> 02:04:04,457
But now, everything's clear.

1300
02:04:06,291 --> 02:04:10,374
Love can't be more
important than someone's life.

1301
02:04:14,291 --> 02:04:15,374
Don't you worry.

1302
02:04:17,541 --> 02:04:23,040
Zaara will marry the
person of her parent's choice.

1303
02:04:25,208 --> 02:04:29,290
Prepare for the wedding.
l'll talk to Zaara.

1304
02:04:33,208 --> 02:04:40,040
l promise you that she will
willingly agree to the marriage.

1305
02:04:49,208 --> 02:04:53,290
ls every son from
your country like you?

1306
02:04:57,208 --> 02:04:58,374
l don't know.

1307
02:04:59,958 --> 02:05:06,124
But yes, every mother in my
country is exactly like you.

1308
02:06:04,791 --> 02:06:08,207
lf you think that
l've made a wrong..

1309
02:06:08,291 --> 02:06:10,790
..decision then just tell me.

1310
02:06:12,791 --> 02:06:15,124
No one will be able to stop
me from taking you to lndia.

1311
02:06:23,333 --> 02:06:25,124
Your decision is absolutely right.

1312
02:06:27,625 --> 02:06:30,040
This has happened because of
one silly mistake on my part.

1313
02:06:31,875 --> 02:06:35,457
l'd made a promise to
myself that l won't break.

1314
02:06:37,125 --> 02:06:39,290
lf only l'd been able to stop
myself when l saw you yesterday.

1315
02:06:39,375 --> 02:06:40,457
That..

1316
02:06:42,541 --> 02:06:45,790
One silly mistake of yours will help
get me through the rest of my life.

1317
02:06:49,875 --> 02:06:56,040
lf you'd taken that away from me
then what would l take back with me?

1318
02:06:59,791 --> 02:07:01,540
Why is God doing this to us?

1319
02:07:02,791 --> 02:07:04,957
l've never done
anything wrong in my life.

1320
02:07:06,208 --> 02:07:08,374
So, why is he punishing me
like this?

1321
02:07:17,458 --> 02:07:22,040
l'm keeping two
moments of your life with me.

1322
02:07:25,958 --> 02:07:27,707
And l'm giving two
moments of my life to you.

1323
02:07:31,041 --> 02:07:33,040
These two moments are
the symbol of our love.

1324
02:07:34,541 --> 02:07:35,957
These two moments make
our loνe story.

1325
02:07:40,208 --> 02:07:42,790
Now, we'll live our
lives on these two moments.

1326
02:07:47,708 --> 02:07:52,957
But with a smile.

1327
02:07:57,208 --> 02:07:58,874
Neither will our love weaken.

1328
02:08:02,625 --> 02:08:04,457
Nor will our duties
remain unfulfilled.

1329
02:08:10,916 --> 02:08:15,624
You'll honour your
parents by being a good wife.

1330
02:08:15,708 --> 02:08:22,457
And l'll fulfil father's
dreams back in the village.

1331
02:08:27,500 --> 02:08:32,207
And after you've had
eight to ten children..

1332
02:08:32,291 --> 02:08:35,707
..bring everyone along for a visit.

1333
02:08:37,916 --> 02:08:44,790
l'll take you for a ride on a
cycle and show you a new village.

1334
02:08:46,958 --> 02:08:53,040
But after haνing eight to ten kids,
l won't be able to sit on a cycle.

1335
02:08:54,208 --> 02:08:57,207
Yes, you've got a point.

1336
02:08:58,541 --> 02:09:02,624
Then l'll arrange for a tractor.

1337
02:09:20,291 --> 02:09:30,290


1338
02:09:39,666 --> 02:09:44,707
"Was that you or was
that just a fragrant wind?"

1339
02:09:44,916 --> 02:09:50,457
"Was that you or were
there colours everywhere?"

1340
02:09:51,208 --> 02:09:56,124
"Was that you or were
those shinning pathways?"

1341
02:09:56,375 --> 02:10:02,207
"Was that you or were those
songs resounding in the atmosphere?"

1342
02:10:02,541 --> 02:10:07,624
"Was it you l found,
or was it my destiny?"

1343
02:10:07,708 --> 02:10:13,874
"Was it you or was
there magic in the air?"

1344
02:10:13,958 --> 02:10:18,957
"Just for two moments, the caravans
of our dreams made a stop."

1345
02:10:19,208 --> 02:10:24,707
"And then you went
your way and l went mine."

1346
02:10:25,375 --> 02:10:30,457
"Just for two moments,
existed the story of our hearts."

1347
02:10:30,625 --> 02:10:48,457
"And then you went
your way and l went mine."

1348
02:11:26,916 --> 02:11:28,957
lt's my wedding day today, Abba.

1349
02:11:32,291 --> 02:11:34,124
Aren't you going to give me away?

1350
02:11:35,708 --> 02:11:38,707
Aren't you going to put your
hand on my head and bless me?

1351
02:11:49,041 --> 02:11:51,124
Please forgive me, my dear.

1352
02:11:53,791 --> 02:12:00,540
l don't know whether this is
my obligation or my weakness.

1353
02:12:05,125 --> 02:12:06,457
Please forgive me.

1354
02:12:27,458 --> 02:12:33,457
This is a holy amulet.
This will protect you.

1355
02:12:34,916 --> 02:12:39,207
The moment you cross the border,
take out the coins..

1356
02:12:39,291 --> 02:12:42,124
..and give them to someone needy.

1357
02:12:51,458 --> 02:12:56,207
My religion does not permit,
but still, now onwards..

1358
02:12:56,291 --> 02:13:00,207
..l'll pray to Allah
everyday and ask him..

1359
02:13:00,291 --> 02:13:04,124
..to give you Zaara
in every other birth.

1360
02:13:27,041 --> 02:13:28,124
l'm leaving.

1361
02:13:53,625 --> 02:13:54,707
Listen.

1362
02:13:58,708 --> 02:14:00,124
Sign here.

1363
02:14:02,458 --> 02:14:03,540
What's this?

1364
02:14:03,958 --> 02:14:05,040
Here.

1365
02:14:05,625 --> 02:14:09,457
lt says here that my
name is Rajesh Rathore.

1366
02:14:10,125 --> 02:14:12,957
l work for the
lndian lntelligence RAW.

1367
02:14:13,041 --> 02:14:14,624
Critical.. political.. secrecy.

1368
02:14:15,125 --> 02:14:18,040
Sending Pakistani secrets to lndia..
- That's correct.

1369
02:14:18,208 --> 02:14:22,124
No way. My name is Veer
Pratap Singh, ex-lndian Air Force.

1370
02:14:22,875 --> 02:14:24,207
l'd come here just two
days ago to visit somebody..

1371
02:14:24,291 --> 02:14:26,374
..and now, l'm going back.

1372
02:14:27,125 --> 02:14:28,207
My passport is in my bag,
you can check.

1373
02:14:28,291 --> 02:14:30,540
We've found this in your bag.

1374
02:14:31,208 --> 02:14:34,207
Your name is written
clearly as Rajesh Rathore.

1375
02:14:34,541 --> 02:14:35,624
Let me see.

1376
02:14:35,791 --> 02:14:37,874
We have witnesses too
who can recognise you.

1377
02:14:40,208 --> 02:14:43,457
What's going on? Why
are you doing this?

1378
02:14:43,541 --> 02:14:45,874
Okay. You were just saying that
you were here to meet somebody.

1379
02:14:46,750 --> 02:14:49,124
Tell us their names,
we'll call them.

1380
02:14:49,416 --> 02:14:51,790
Yes.. l'm..

1381
02:14:54,666 --> 02:14:55,749
l'm here..

1382
02:14:57,625 --> 02:14:58,707
Tell us.

1383
02:15:02,125 --> 02:15:03,207
l didn't come to meet anybody.

1384
02:15:03,291 --> 02:15:05,374
Wow, what loνe!

1385
02:15:06,500 --> 02:15:09,374
lf you take her name,
she will be disgraced?

1386
02:15:16,375 --> 02:15:22,290
You'll ruin yourself, but
won't let your love be cursed.

1387
02:15:23,375 --> 02:15:27,957
Yes, Mr. Veer. This is
exactly what l expected of you.

1388
02:15:31,208 --> 02:15:34,207
Mr. Veer, there's one thing
that is very special about..

1389
02:15:34,291 --> 02:15:35,374
..both our countries.

1390
02:15:39,208 --> 02:15:44,624
On the basis of power and money,
anything is possible. lsn't that so?

1391
02:15:47,958 --> 02:15:51,207
What were you thinking?
That you could come here..

1392
02:15:51,291 --> 02:15:55,207
..and declare your
love for my wife-to-be..

1393
02:15:55,291 --> 02:15:58,207
..in front of everyone and leave.

1394
02:15:58,291 --> 02:16:03,707
And l'd stand aside
and watch the whole show?

1395
02:16:07,375 --> 02:16:13,290
Mr. Veer, l'm about to
live my life with a woman..

1396
02:16:14,708 --> 02:16:17,040
..who's in love with someone else.

1397
02:16:18,375 --> 02:16:23,040
And it's my bad luck that l can't
even back off from this marriage.

1398
02:16:25,875 --> 02:16:26,957
Can you imagine?

1399
02:16:30,291 --> 02:16:36,624
Can you imagine.. everyday of
my life will be a living hell.

1400
02:16:39,875 --> 02:16:42,040
You and Zaara were the
ones who dared to love.

1401
02:16:45,541 --> 02:16:46,874
Why should l be put to test?

1402
02:16:54,541 --> 02:16:57,540
Either your life
should be a living hell..

1403
02:16:59,708 --> 02:17:00,790
Or Zaara's.

1404
02:17:02,958 --> 02:17:04,040
Not mine

1405
02:17:11,458 --> 02:17:13,874
You take great pride
in your love, right?

1406
02:17:15,791 --> 02:17:17,790
So, now you're being tested.

1407
02:17:19,875 --> 02:17:26,290
l can make Zaara's life heaven or
hell. But it's all in your hands.

1408
02:17:28,708 --> 02:17:33,707
As long as you sit silently
within the four walls of a prison..

1409
02:17:35,291 --> 02:17:39,374
..Zaara's life will be
more beautiful than heaven.

1410
02:17:41,625 --> 02:17:45,207
The moment you open your mouth,
Zaara's life will..

1411
02:17:45,291 --> 02:17:47,624
..become worse than hell.

1412
02:17:52,041 --> 02:17:55,457
Veer Pratap Singh's
identity has to be destroyed..

1413
02:17:55,541 --> 02:17:58,874
..in order to give Zaara
a good life.

1414
02:18:07,625 --> 02:18:11,457
Now, this.. is the true
test of love.

1415
02:18:14,791 --> 02:18:15,874
l'll take your leaνe.

1416
02:18:20,291 --> 02:18:21,540
lt's time for the wedding.

1417
02:18:23,041 --> 02:18:24,207
Either you disgrace
the names of Zaara..

1418
02:18:24,291 --> 02:18:26,624
..and her family and
buy your freedom..

1419
02:18:27,458 --> 02:18:29,207
..or sign on those papers and..

1420
02:18:29,291 --> 02:18:31,290
..ensure a lifetime of
happiness for Zaara.

1421
02:18:33,708 --> 02:18:34,790
The decision is in your hands.

1422
02:18:37,041 --> 02:18:38,124
Goodbye.

1423
02:18:39,291 --> 02:18:49,290


1424
02:18:50,875 --> 02:18:58,624
"Why is there a tradition
of cruelty?"

1425
02:18:59,291 --> 02:19:05,540
"Why is the society the way it is?"

1426
02:19:06,208 --> 02:19:14,290
"These traditions of this world.. l
am completely oνerwhelmed by them."

1427
02:19:14,375 --> 02:19:16,207
"Do not ask what my
complaints are.."

1428
02:19:16,291 --> 02:19:18,540
"..or why l've been
given this unhappiness."

1429
02:19:18,625 --> 02:19:22,707
"What can l tell you,
why is love a crime."

1430
02:19:22,958 --> 02:19:31,374
"Why does one cry?
Why does this happen?"

1431
02:19:31,458 --> 02:19:35,624
"Why is everyone a
stranger to his heart?"

1432
02:19:35,708 --> 02:19:43,540
"What turn has this story taken?"

1433
02:19:43,625 --> 02:19:45,540
"What sort of world is
this that we live in?"

1434
02:19:45,625 --> 02:19:47,624
"Where sorrows wear
the face of happiness?

1435
02:19:47,708 --> 02:19:49,790
"What sort of world is
this that we live in."

1436
02:19:49,875 --> 02:19:51,957
"Where sorrows wear
the face of happiness?"

1437
02:19:52,041 --> 02:19:56,290
"Who do l call my own
and who is a stranger?"

1438
02:19:56,375 --> 02:20:04,290
"What turn has this story taken?"

1439
02:20:07,375 --> 02:20:11,707
Ms. Zaara Hayaat Khan,
daughter of Jehangir Hayaat Khan.

1440
02:20:12,041 --> 02:20:15,124
Your marriage has been
fixed with Raza Shirazi.

1441
02:20:15,291 --> 02:20:19,207
Son of Abdul Malik
Shirazi at a dowry of..

1442
02:20:19,291 --> 02:20:26,790
..Rs.5 million. Do you
accept this marriage?

1443
02:20:26,958 --> 02:20:35,124
"What turn has my story taken?"

1444
02:20:35,291 --> 02:20:38,374
Do you accept that your
name is Rajesh Rathore or no?

1445
02:20:38,541 --> 02:20:45,124
"My love story. My love story."

1446
02:20:45,375 --> 02:20:48,374
"What turn has my story taken?"

1447
02:20:48,458 --> 02:20:53,374
l accept.

1448
02:20:53,625 --> 02:20:57,624
"What turn has my story taken?

1449
02:20:57,708 --> 02:21:09,124
"What turn has my story taken?"

1450
02:21:12,375 --> 02:21:16,207
The bus that left from
Lahore met with an accident..

1451
02:21:16,291 --> 02:21:17,374
..before it reached lndia.

1452
02:21:19,208 --> 02:21:20,290
Nobody survived.

1453
02:21:21,875 --> 02:21:24,040
My name too was on
the passenger list.

1454
02:21:26,208 --> 02:21:31,040
l was happy that Maati and
father would hear about my death.

1455
02:21:33,625 --> 02:21:35,707
lf they got the news
that l was missing..

1456
02:21:36,875 --> 02:21:41,124
..then they wouldn't have been
able to live or die in peace.

1457
02:21:43,041 --> 02:21:47,957
Now, in lndia, Veer Pratap
Singh was dead and in Pakistan.

1458
02:21:48,875 --> 02:21:50,707
There was no sign of
Veer Singh left.

1459
02:21:53,958 --> 02:21:57,707
Now, his only identity was..

1460
02:22:00,125 --> 02:22:03,957
Prisoner number 786.

1461
02:22:17,708 --> 02:22:19,457
786.

1462
02:22:22,625 --> 02:22:25,707
My country owes you
22 years of your life.

1463
02:22:28,041 --> 02:22:30,624
l can't bring back these 22 years.

1464
02:22:34,458 --> 02:22:35,957
But l take a vow.

1465
02:22:37,125 --> 02:22:39,457
That l won't put flowers
on my father's grave until..

1466
02:22:40,041 --> 02:22:42,207
..Veer Pratap Singh
doesn't get his name..

1467
02:22:42,291 --> 02:22:45,540
..his identity and his country back.

1468
02:23:10,625 --> 02:23:13,040
So, Ms. Samiya Siddique,
this is your first case?

1469
02:23:13,125 --> 02:23:14,624
Yes.
- Congratulations.

1470
02:23:14,708 --> 02:23:15,790
Thank you, sir.

1471
02:23:15,875 --> 02:23:17,207
And you're the defence
counsel on behalf of the..

1472
02:23:17,291 --> 02:23:18,457
..Human Rights Commission?

1473
02:23:18,541 --> 02:23:20,790
That's right, sir.
- Good. That's good.

1474
02:23:21,708 --> 02:23:23,207
No one is
representing the Prosecution?

1475
02:23:23,291 --> 02:23:25,290
Well, sir, they should be coming.

1476
02:23:25,375 --> 02:23:26,457
May l come in sir?

1477
02:23:27,291 --> 02:23:28,624
Oh, it's you, Mr. Zakir.

1478
02:23:30,458 --> 02:23:33,040
Good morning, sir.
- Morning. Come in, take a seat.

1479
02:23:34,541 --> 02:23:35,874
That's Mr. Zakir Ahmed.

1480
02:23:36,541 --> 02:23:40,374
l know. l know him very well.

1481
02:23:42,708 --> 02:23:43,790
Come.

1482
02:23:43,875 --> 02:23:46,874
Sorry, Your Honour, you
know the traffic of Lahore..

1483
02:23:47,791 --> 02:23:49,207
Zakir sir, are you
presenting the case..

1484
02:23:49,291 --> 02:23:52,540
..on behalf of the
Government of Pakistan?

1485
02:23:52,625 --> 02:23:55,707
Yes, sir. Actually, l've not
been to court since many days.

1486
02:23:55,958 --> 02:23:57,207
People maybe thinking that
Zakir Ahmed has forgotten..

1487
02:23:57,291 --> 02:23:59,124
..how to fight a case.

1488
02:23:59,791 --> 02:24:01,957
And anyway, l think this
case is very interesting.

1489
02:24:02,458 --> 02:24:03,540
What do you think, Saamiya?

1490
02:24:05,541 --> 02:24:08,290
So, you both know one another?

1491
02:24:08,791 --> 02:24:12,290
Of course. Saamiya was
working for us earlier.

1492
02:24:12,375 --> 02:24:15,207
But perhaps, she didn't
approve of the way we worked..

1493
02:24:15,291 --> 02:24:17,707
..so, she went over to
the Human Rights camp.

1494
02:24:18,541 --> 02:24:22,957
She's a very capable lady, it'll be
fun to fight the case opposite her.

1495
02:24:25,458 --> 02:24:29,290
There was a special purpose
for calling both of you here.

1496
02:24:30,958 --> 02:24:33,207
lt would be better if
both the parties can have..

1497
02:24:33,291 --> 02:24:35,457
..an out of court settlement.

1498
02:24:36,875 --> 02:24:38,790
Otherwise, the court has fixed
the date for day after tomorrow.

1499
02:24:39,625 --> 02:24:42,457
But yes, if the case does not
start the day after tomorrow..

1500
02:24:43,041 --> 02:24:47,290
..then the next date could be after
six months or maybe eνen a year.

1501
02:24:47,458 --> 02:24:50,707
We're ready, sir. But if the
defence needs more time then..

1502
02:24:50,791 --> 02:24:52,707
Defence is ready, sir.
- But Saamiya..

1503
02:24:53,708 --> 02:24:57,207
Sir, you can fix it for day after
tomorrow. My client has waited..

1504
02:24:57,291 --> 02:25:01,874
..for 22 years to get justice.
l can't make him wait any more.

1505
02:25:01,958 --> 02:25:04,040
Okay, then that's fixed.

1506
02:25:06,208 --> 02:25:07,874
l thank you both for coming here.

1507
02:25:09,125 --> 02:25:10,707
Good day.
- Good day, sir.

1508
02:25:13,708 --> 02:25:18,874
Okay, Saamiya. l'll see
you in court. Good day.

1509
02:25:25,208 --> 02:25:27,207
This was an impossible
case right from the start.

1510
02:25:27,375 --> 02:25:30,124
And now, with Zakir Ahmed's arrival,
there's absolutely no chance.

1511
02:25:31,291 --> 02:25:35,040
But this case is too small for
his portfolio.. l don't know why.

1512
02:25:35,458 --> 02:25:37,124
l can't understand anything.

1513
02:25:37,625 --> 02:25:41,124
Listen, just make any
excuse and drop this case.

1514
02:25:41,708 --> 02:25:44,207
This is your first case
and the way Zakir Ahmed..

1515
02:25:44,291 --> 02:25:48,540
..insults the opposition,
he'll ruin your career.

1516
02:25:48,875 --> 02:25:50,040
That's exactly what he wants.

1517
02:25:50,958 --> 02:25:53,207
What do you mean?
- Sahil, do one thing.

1518
02:25:53,458 --> 02:25:55,624
Go back to the office and
make a list of the witnesses.

1519
02:25:55,791 --> 02:25:56,957
l'll be there in a while.

1520
02:25:57,041 --> 02:25:59,290
But where're you going?
- To meet Zakir Ahmed.

1521
02:25:59,375 --> 02:26:02,040
Okay. What? Saamiya.

1522
02:26:04,541 --> 02:26:11,290
Ms. Saamiya Siddique, you'd sworn
that you'd never step into my office.

1523
02:26:12,291 --> 02:26:14,540
Then how could you
bear to come here today?

1524
02:26:15,375 --> 02:26:17,207
There's nothing like that, sir.

1525
02:26:17,291 --> 02:26:20,624
Just that my
principles differed from yours.

1526
02:26:21,208 --> 02:26:25,207
And l thought that if l could not
respect working by your principles..

1527
02:26:25,291 --> 02:26:31,457
..then it's better that l leave.
- lnteresting, very interesting.

1528
02:26:32,458 --> 02:26:34,874
You've developed great
principles at a young age.

1529
02:26:35,125 --> 02:26:37,874
My principles have been passed
on to me as my father's legacy.

1530
02:26:39,458 --> 02:26:42,207
Saamiya, do you know that
you're the first person..

1531
02:26:42,291 --> 02:26:45,624
..who refused to take a
case offered by Zakir Ahmed.

1532
02:26:46,625 --> 02:26:49,957
Here, people wait for years in the
hope of getting their first case.

1533
02:26:51,125 --> 02:26:54,624
But l recognised your capability,
l chose you.

1534
02:26:55,291 --> 02:26:58,207
l ignored your age,
your inexperience..

1535
02:26:58,291 --> 02:27:00,290
..and even the fact
that you're a woman.

1536
02:27:00,875 --> 02:27:02,290
And what did you do
in spite of that?

1537
02:27:02,791 --> 02:27:04,707
You threw the case back in my face.

1538
02:27:05,958 --> 02:27:08,457
lt would've set
a criminal free, sir.

1539
02:27:09,291 --> 02:27:10,707
And according to me,
that would've been wrong.

1540
02:27:10,791 --> 02:27:13,707
lt's not a lawyer's job to
decide what's right or wrong.

1541
02:27:13,791 --> 02:27:15,040
lt's the court's job.

1542
02:27:15,208 --> 02:27:19,707
A lawyer's duty is to win the case
under any circumstance. Nothing else.

1543
02:27:21,208 --> 02:27:23,124
Well, that's the
difference between you and me, sir.

1544
02:27:24,041 --> 02:27:25,707
Your principle is to fight to win..

1545
02:27:26,208 --> 02:27:28,124
..and my principle is
to fight for the truth.

1546
02:27:29,458 --> 02:27:35,874
lnteresting, very interesting. So,
now you're giving me lessons in law.

1547
02:27:36,875 --> 02:27:38,957
This was all that was
left for me to experience.

1548
02:27:40,041 --> 02:27:44,874
Let's forget the past. Otherwise,
we'll keep opening up old wounds.

1549
02:27:46,291 --> 02:27:49,207
lf you've taken the trouble
to come all the way here..

1550
02:27:49,291 --> 02:27:52,040
..then it must be
something important. Sit.

1551
02:27:52,958 --> 02:27:55,790
What can Zakir Ahmed do for you?

1552
02:28:00,625 --> 02:28:03,540
Look, sir, being my first
case it's obvious that..

1553
02:28:04,458 --> 02:28:06,707
..l will make some mistakes.

1554
02:28:08,625 --> 02:28:11,540
And now that you're the opposition,
the problems will increase.

1555
02:28:12,875 --> 02:28:15,707
Because of some trifle on my part..

1556
02:28:16,458 --> 02:28:18,207
..l don't want that
lndian prisoner's freedom..

1557
02:28:18,291 --> 02:28:20,207
..to be revoked. Because..

1558
02:28:20,291 --> 02:28:22,124
He's completely innocent.
That's true.

1559
02:28:23,541 --> 02:28:25,290
A great injustice has
been done to him, sir.

1560
02:28:26,958 --> 02:28:29,624
And he truly deserves his freedom.

1561
02:28:33,291 --> 02:28:35,624
Finally, you've
stooped down to our level.

1562
02:28:36,791 --> 02:28:41,124
Basically you've come asking for
help to win your first case, right?

1563
02:28:43,708 --> 02:28:48,040
Defeating Zakir Ahmed takes your
career off to a flying start. No?

1564
02:28:48,875 --> 02:28:52,457
Have you forgotten that Zakir
Ahmed has never lost a case as yet?

1565
02:28:52,875 --> 02:28:55,374
And now, it's νery
important for me to win this case.

1566
02:28:56,375 --> 02:28:58,207
Because l want to teach a lesson to..

1567
02:28:58,291 --> 02:29:00,207
..headstrong
youngsters like yourself..

1568
02:29:00,291 --> 02:29:05,707
..the repercussions of not
following Zakir Ahmed's principles.

1569
02:29:08,958 --> 02:29:10,624
What's the matter,
Ms. Saamiya Siddique?

1570
02:29:11,625 --> 02:29:14,207
Lost faith in your
principles of truth that you..

1571
02:29:14,291 --> 02:29:17,040
..come begging for a win?

1572
02:29:18,125 --> 02:29:19,207
Please forgive me, sir.

1573
02:29:19,291 --> 02:29:22,374
For a while, l thought
that you were almost human.

1574
02:29:24,125 --> 02:29:27,207
l just came to discuss if
there's any possibility of..

1575
02:29:27,291 --> 02:29:31,624
..giving this man his freedom
without taking this case to court.

1576
02:29:32,875 --> 02:29:35,457
But you mistook my
humanity to be my weakness.

1577
02:29:38,458 --> 02:29:43,290
Now, we'll meet in court. Be
prepared to lose your first case.

1578
02:29:44,458 --> 02:29:49,790
Because now, prisoner 786
will be sent to lndia, and..

1579
02:29:49,875 --> 02:29:52,207
..neither you nor the
State of Pakistan will stop me.

1580
02:29:58,291 --> 02:29:59,374
lnteresting.

1581
02:30:00,541 --> 02:30:01,624
Very interesting.

1582
02:30:06,958 --> 02:30:08,290
Can l ask you one question?

1583
02:30:10,375 --> 02:30:12,707
You hadn't spoken to
anyone in all these years..

1584
02:30:13,875 --> 02:30:16,040
..then why did you tell me
your story?

1585
02:30:20,708 --> 02:30:24,290
You called me by my name.

1586
02:30:25,625 --> 02:30:26,707
What?

1587
02:30:28,208 --> 02:30:32,874
You're the first person who
didn't doubt my innocence.

1588
02:30:33,458 --> 02:30:38,707
The first person who
belieνed that l am Veer Singh.

1589
02:30:43,041 --> 02:30:48,707
The truth is that in all these years,
l'd forgotten my own identity.

1590
02:30:52,208 --> 02:30:55,124
You reminded me of who l am.

1591
02:30:56,791 --> 02:30:59,290
You gave me respect by
calling me by my name.

1592
02:31:00,875 --> 02:31:04,790
Veer Pratap Singh.

1593
02:31:10,708 --> 02:31:15,207
For a prisoner who has
been insulted for the..

1594
02:31:15,291 --> 02:31:17,290
..last 22 years..

1595
02:31:18,875 --> 02:31:22,707
..this was a great thing.
Great thing.

1596
02:31:34,041 --> 02:31:35,207
Now, l'll eat some more, okay?

1597
02:31:41,875 --> 02:31:43,540
lt's our first day
in court tomorrow.

1598
02:31:43,875 --> 02:31:45,290
You remember your promise,
don't you?

1599
02:31:46,708 --> 02:31:47,790
That you're going to
change out of the garb of..

1600
02:31:47,875 --> 02:31:49,124
..786 and come as..

1601
02:31:49,208 --> 02:31:51,457
..Squadron Leader
Veer Pratap Singh.

1602
02:31:53,875 --> 02:31:55,790
No.
- What?

1603
02:31:57,291 --> 02:31:59,874
Do you remember your promise?
- Of course, l remember it.

1604
02:31:59,958 --> 02:32:02,207
Under no circumstances am
l to mention the name of..

1605
02:32:02,291 --> 02:32:03,540
..Zaara or the Hayaat Khan family.

1606
02:32:04,625 --> 02:32:08,874
You keep your promise,
and l'll keep mine.

1607
02:32:38,791 --> 02:32:43,124
Your Honour, Defence would
like to call its first witness.

1608
02:32:47,458 --> 02:32:49,707
Defence calls its first witness.

1609
02:32:52,875 --> 02:32:54,874
Defence rests, Your Honour.

1610
02:33:58,041 --> 02:34:01,040
l call upon the
Prosecution to present its case.

1611
02:34:04,041 --> 02:34:05,124
Your Honour..

1612
02:34:06,458 --> 02:34:11,457
A man has been in prison
for the past 22 years..

1613
02:34:12,958 --> 02:34:15,207
..and that prison is in Pakistan.
And that man..

1614
02:34:15,291 --> 02:34:22,707
..who was imprisoned in a
Pakistani jail since 22 years is..

1615
02:34:23,625 --> 02:34:26,124
..an lndian.

1616
02:34:28,541 --> 02:34:35,207
Hearing this, you, me, and
everyone sitting in this courtroom..

1617
02:34:35,291 --> 02:34:40,874
..will have tears in their eyes.
And we'll hope for some way..

1618
02:34:41,541 --> 02:34:45,957
..that man can go back to
his country, to his home.

1619
02:34:47,041 --> 02:34:50,790
Because we are human
and we've been taught..

1620
02:34:50,875 --> 02:34:55,040
..to respect all human beings.
But Your Honour..

1621
02:34:56,291 --> 02:35:00,790
ln a court of law what man
can't see, the law can..

1622
02:35:01,625 --> 02:35:04,540
..and according to the law the
State is bigger than the individual.

1623
02:35:04,958 --> 02:35:07,957
And for a person who works against
the interests of the country..

1624
02:35:08,041 --> 02:35:11,290
..even being sentenced
to death 22 times is less.

1625
02:35:18,875 --> 02:35:21,624
This case is as transparent
as water.

1626
02:35:22,291 --> 02:35:24,790
There's no question of any doubt.

1627
02:35:25,541 --> 02:35:27,457
Prosecution will in a
matter of just 30 minutes..

1628
02:35:27,541 --> 02:35:30,540
..and with the help of just three
witnesses, prove without a doubt..

1629
02:35:30,791 --> 02:35:33,207
..that the defendant
Rajesh Rathore is not worthy..

1630
02:35:33,291 --> 02:35:36,290
..of going back to his country or
his home until the day of his death.

1631
02:35:37,291 --> 02:35:38,374
That's all, Your Honour.

1632
02:35:40,208 --> 02:35:43,374
Now, l call upon the
Defence to present their case.

1633
02:35:46,291 --> 02:35:48,624
Ms. Siddique, best of luck.

1634
02:36:17,875 --> 02:36:22,040
Your Honour, Prosecution Counsel
Mr. Zaheer Khan was very quick to..

1635
02:36:22,125 --> 02:36:26,124
Zakir Ahmed says that this
case is as transparent as water.

1636
02:36:26,625 --> 02:36:29,040
But Mr. Zaheer Khan forgets..
- Ms. Saamiya Siddique.

1637
02:36:29,125 --> 02:36:32,207
My name is Zakir Ahmed! - Being
called by another name once..

1638
02:36:32,291 --> 02:36:34,957
..has infuriated you to such
an extent? Then just think..

1639
02:36:35,041 --> 02:36:36,207
..if you were called by
another name every single day..

1640
02:36:36,291 --> 02:36:37,374
..for 22 years..

1641
02:36:37,458 --> 02:36:39,040
Can you imagine what
would it feel like then?

1642
02:36:44,041 --> 02:36:47,207
Your Honour, this case is not being
fought to send an lndian back..

1643
02:36:47,291 --> 02:36:49,957
..to his country or his home.

1644
02:36:50,625 --> 02:36:52,207
This case is being
fought to give a man back..

1645
02:36:52,291 --> 02:36:55,207
..his identity, his individuality.
Someone is asking you..

1646
02:36:55,291 --> 02:37:00,874
..to give him back his name.
He's telling you that..

1647
02:37:01,708 --> 02:37:03,124
l am Veer Pratap Singh.

1648
02:37:03,958 --> 02:37:07,290
Ex-lndian Air Force Officer
Squadron Leader Veer Pratap Singh.

1649
02:37:09,708 --> 02:37:12,040
Just give me back the
respectability of my name.

1650
02:37:12,958 --> 02:37:14,290
l don't want anything else.

1651
02:37:15,291 --> 02:37:19,457
Maybe not in 30 minutes
like the Prosecution Counsel..

1652
02:37:19,875 --> 02:37:23,207
..but l will definitely prove that
this man is not Rajesh Rathore..

1653
02:37:23,291 --> 02:37:26,874
..but Veer Pratap Singh. Then
whether to send him to lndia..

1654
02:37:27,041 --> 02:37:29,707
..or keep him in Pakistan,
that is in your hands.

1655
02:37:30,458 --> 02:37:31,624
That's all, Your Honour.

1656
02:37:33,291 --> 02:37:35,874
Now, Prosecution may
call upon it's witnesses.

1657
02:37:36,041 --> 02:37:42,040
l'd like to call upon my first
witness police officer Dilbaaz Khan.

1658
02:37:42,291 --> 02:37:47,624
Who had arrested
Rajesh Rathore 22 years ago.

1659
02:37:48,625 --> 02:37:58,624


1660
02:38:40,541 --> 02:38:45,624
"The winding Roads Beckon us."

1661
02:38:45,708 --> 02:38:50,374
"Where have we come to?"

1662
02:38:51,291 --> 02:38:56,374
"Eyes are shaded with dreams.."

1663
02:38:56,458 --> 02:39:06,457
"Where have we come to?"

1664
02:39:09,625 --> 02:39:15,040
Mr. Dilbaaz Khan, l know a
lot of time has passed by.

1665
02:39:15,875 --> 02:39:19,707
Could you tell the court
without any doubt or hesitation..

1666
02:39:20,375 --> 02:39:24,540
..who this man is?
- Yes, sir, l remember very well.

1667
02:39:25,041 --> 02:39:29,124
This man is an lndian spy. He's
an agent of RAW, Rajesh Rathore.

1668
02:39:30,208 --> 02:39:32,207
Some 22 years ago,
Anwar Ali and myself..

1669
02:39:32,291 --> 02:39:34,207
We forced him to get
off a bus going from..

1670
02:39:34,291 --> 02:39:36,540
..Lahore to lndia and arrested him.

1671
02:39:37,625 --> 02:39:39,624
We had received an
intelligence report..

1672
02:39:39,875 --> 02:39:43,040
..that this man was
conspiring against Pakistan.

1673
02:39:43,125 --> 02:39:47,207
Good. - Mr. Anwar Ali, can you
tell me, if you found in his bag..

1674
02:39:47,875 --> 02:39:52,540
..a passport identifying
him as Rajesh Rathore?

1675
02:39:52,958 --> 02:39:57,040
Then how is it possible
that this same man's ticket..

1676
02:39:57,208 --> 02:39:58,957
..was booked in the
name of Veer Pratap Singh?

1677
02:39:59,625 --> 02:40:01,957
But sir, that was the thing..

1678
02:40:02,708 --> 02:40:05,207
Honour, this person
also had a passport..

1679
02:40:05,291 --> 02:40:07,790
..in the name of Veer Pratap Singh.

1680
02:40:08,208 --> 02:40:11,540
And how could one
person have two passports?

1681
02:40:12,208 --> 02:40:15,624
For this reason, our
suspicion changed to certainty.

1682
02:40:15,958 --> 02:40:21,290
And after we questioned him, he
himself signed the affidavit..

1683
02:40:21,375 --> 02:40:23,374
l, Rajesh Rathore..

1684
02:40:49,125 --> 02:40:54,457
"Golden warmth that
sprinkles our paths.."

1685
02:40:54,541 --> 02:40:59,707
"..has warmed our lives."

1686
02:41:10,291 --> 02:41:15,790
"The earth sleeps
wearing a blanket of ice."

1687
02:41:15,875 --> 02:41:20,874
"Our hearts are afire."

1688
02:41:21,041 --> 02:41:26,457
"Winds change course,
bodies shiver."

1689
02:41:26,541 --> 02:41:36,457
"Where have we come to?"

1690
02:41:40,875 --> 02:41:44,040
l've being seeing him
for the last ten years.

1691
02:41:44,958 --> 02:41:47,540
He was always quiet
and kept to himself.

1692
02:41:47,958 --> 02:41:50,040
He never communicated with anyone.

1693
02:41:51,041 --> 02:41:54,207
But whenever a
prisoner was ill or upset..

1694
02:41:54,291 --> 02:42:00,457
..he would go forth to
heal him and comfort him.

1695
02:42:01,958 --> 02:42:06,457
l don't know if he is Veer
Pratap Singh or Rajesh Rathore..

1696
02:42:07,708 --> 02:42:10,874
..for me, he's just 786.

1697
02:42:12,875 --> 02:42:13,957
God's own man.

1698
02:42:16,625 --> 02:42:21,707
Yes, sir. This Hindu here
is Allah's noble servant.

1699
02:42:22,875 --> 02:42:25,207
He's spent 22 years in prison..

1700
02:42:25,291 --> 02:42:28,707
There can't be greater
punishment than this.

1701
02:42:30,875 --> 02:42:35,540
Send him back to his homeland.

1702
02:42:36,708 --> 02:42:40,124
Send him back.

1703
02:42:40,291 --> 02:42:42,207
Mr. Majid Khan, it looks like..

1704
02:42:42,291 --> 02:42:46,040
..you have no great love
for your country Pakistan.

1705
02:42:47,125 --> 02:42:51,540
lf it were up to you, then every
person who had spied upon Pakistan..

1706
02:42:51,625 --> 02:42:55,207
..every conspirator,
should be set free by the court.

1707
02:42:55,791 --> 02:42:59,207
Sir, that's not what l meant..
- Just reply with a yes or a no.

1708
02:42:59,291 --> 02:43:02,457
Mr Majid Khan, only
with a yes or no.

1709
02:43:05,125 --> 02:43:06,207
No.
- Good.

1710
02:43:07,208 --> 02:43:08,290
Your witness.

1711
02:43:11,208 --> 02:43:12,540
No questions, Your Honour.

1712
02:43:27,208 --> 02:43:32,624
"l wonder when it will
stop pouring."

1713
02:43:32,791 --> 02:43:38,124
"You've got excuses
a plenty to love."

1714
02:43:48,708 --> 02:43:54,207
"lt seems like there's
a procession of stars."

1715
02:43:54,291 --> 02:43:59,207
"Night is resplendent
only for us."

1716
02:43:59,291 --> 02:44:01,624
"Dreams sparkle.."

1717
02:44:01,708 --> 02:44:04,457
"They light up our hearts."

1718
02:44:04,541 --> 02:44:20,124
"Where have we come to?"

1719
02:44:33,041 --> 02:44:38,207
The next date for this
case is after one week..

1720
02:44:38,291 --> 02:44:40,790
..on Monday, 21 st March.

1721
02:44:41,791 --> 02:44:43,874
On that day, l will
hear the Defence's case.

1722
02:44:44,541 --> 02:44:47,290
And immediately after that,
l will pass my judgement.

1723
02:44:48,291 --> 02:44:50,290
Defence should be
ready with their case.

1724
02:44:51,208 --> 02:44:53,207
Adjourned.

1725
02:45:17,791 --> 02:45:19,207
l'll have to mention Zaara's name.

1726
02:45:19,708 --> 02:45:20,790
No.

1727
02:45:20,875 --> 02:45:23,207
Please.. for once..

1728
02:45:23,291 --> 02:45:25,207
Let me bring Zaara
or any one person..

1729
02:45:25,291 --> 02:45:26,790
..from the Hayaat
family to the court..

1730
02:45:26,875 --> 02:45:28,707
..and in a moment, the verdict
will swing to our favour.

1731
02:45:29,625 --> 02:45:30,707
Absolutely not.

1732
02:45:31,708 --> 02:45:35,790
Why don't you try and understand?
We're losing this case.

1733
02:45:36,708 --> 02:45:39,624
The court does not have
time for prisoners like you.

1734
02:45:41,958 --> 02:45:44,790
ln this country, there are too
many prisoners and very few courts.

1735
02:45:46,208 --> 02:45:49,790
A lot of prisoner's cases
come up after they're dead.

1736
02:45:51,458 --> 02:45:53,290
You'll never get such
an opportunity again.

1737
02:45:54,625 --> 02:45:59,457
You'll die lying right here..
you'll die. Don't you understand?

1738
02:46:08,291 --> 02:46:11,040
Zaara must be the
mother of two by now.

1739
02:46:16,458 --> 02:46:22,790
She perhaps has a 21 -year-old
daughter and a 1 9-year old-boy.

1740
02:46:24,375 --> 02:46:27,707
She must've passed through all
the good and bad times of her life.

1741
02:46:30,291 --> 02:46:35,624
Her days, her evenings must've
settled down to a fine rhythm.

1742
02:46:39,791 --> 02:46:42,124
lt must now be a
peaceful life for Zaara.

1743
02:46:44,458 --> 02:46:45,540
Zaara.

1744
02:46:48,541 --> 02:46:51,624
And tomorrow, you'll drag her to
court and in front of everyone..

1745
02:46:51,708 --> 02:46:53,457
..you'll ask her
who's Veer Pratap Singh?

1746
02:46:54,625 --> 02:46:55,957
Questions will be raised.

1747
02:46:57,208 --> 02:46:58,957
What is the relationship
between Veer and Zaara?

1748
02:46:59,041 --> 02:47:01,624
And no one will be able
to understand the answers.

1749
02:47:01,708 --> 02:47:03,540
No one will understand.

1750
02:47:05,625 --> 02:47:09,207
ln an instant, Raza
Shirazi will divorce her.

1751
02:47:09,291 --> 02:47:12,374
Zaara's life will be ruined.

1752
02:47:16,458 --> 02:47:18,790
She must be living peacefully.

1753
02:47:22,875 --> 02:47:26,374
For the last 22 years, l
haνe been guarding her honour.

1754
02:47:28,708 --> 02:47:34,624
Today, how can l trample
upon her honour and go home?

1755
02:47:44,208 --> 02:47:45,790
l can't do that, Saamiya.

1756
02:47:46,708 --> 02:47:49,957
And l know you won't
be able to do it either.

1757
02:47:58,458 --> 02:48:04,957
l'm sorry, for a while, being a
lawyer made me forget my humanity.

1758
02:48:07,541 --> 02:48:08,624
l forgot..

1759
02:48:08,708 --> 02:48:13,207
That Veer and Zaara's names
can never be taken together.

1760
02:48:19,375 --> 02:48:23,624
Now, there's only one way out.
l'll have to go to lndia..

1761
02:48:27,875 --> 02:48:31,540
..to bring Veer Pratap
Singh's identity from his country

1762
02:48:33,208 --> 02:48:34,290
Time is short.

1763
02:48:35,208 --> 02:48:37,707
l'm leaving. Take care.

1764
02:48:42,958 --> 02:48:44,040
Saamiya..

1765
02:48:51,041 --> 02:48:56,874
Until now, this amulet has protected
me, now, it will protect you.

1766
02:49:05,791 --> 02:49:06,874
lf l lose..

1767
02:49:08,458 --> 02:49:10,040
..will you forgive me?

1768
02:49:14,208 --> 02:49:15,374
On one condition.

1769
02:49:18,708 --> 02:49:20,207
Every day, you must bring me..

1770
02:49:20,291 --> 02:49:22,790
..sweets.

1771
02:49:28,541 --> 02:49:29,624
Take care.

1772
02:49:52,458 --> 02:49:53,707
Excuse me.

1773
02:50:02,375 --> 02:50:06,374
Can you show me where
Chaudhary Sumer Singh's house is?

1774
02:50:06,458 --> 02:50:09,040
Yes. The largest house
at the corner there.

1775
02:50:09,125 --> 02:50:11,374
That's Chaudhary sir's house.
- Thanks.

1776
02:50:11,458 --> 02:50:15,290
But who're you looking for?
- For Mr. Singh and his wife.

1777
02:50:16,458 --> 02:50:18,790
lt's been years
since both of them died.

1778
02:50:24,708 --> 02:50:27,874
But if you want to see the house,
you're most welcome.

1779
02:50:28,208 --> 02:50:29,707
That house is always open.

1780
02:50:30,041 --> 02:50:33,624
l'm in a bit of a hurry,
please forgive me, goodbye.

1781
02:51:24,625 --> 02:51:27,040
Zaara, oh, Zaara..

1782
02:51:40,041 --> 02:51:41,124
l'm not sparing you.

1783
02:52:05,708 --> 02:52:07,707
Hey, who're you? What do you want?

1784
02:52:11,041 --> 02:52:12,207
Why are you crying?

1785
02:52:16,625 --> 02:52:18,290
Say something,
are you deaf or what?

1786
02:52:21,041 --> 02:52:23,707
Shabbo, look, here's a visitor.

1787
02:52:24,041 --> 02:52:25,707
And you Jassi.. come here.

1788
02:52:29,625 --> 02:52:31,540
Oh, you'll be the death of me.

1789
02:52:33,208 --> 02:52:35,124
l'll tell your mother
that you aren't studying.

1790
02:52:37,208 --> 02:52:38,790
Yes.. tell me..

1791
02:52:39,041 --> 02:52:40,540
What do you want?

1792
02:52:41,541 --> 02:52:43,457
You're Shabbo?

1793
02:52:44,375 --> 02:52:45,874
Who else can l be?

1794
02:52:46,458 --> 02:52:49,957
And she's..

1795
02:52:50,875 --> 02:52:51,957
Zaara?

1796
02:52:52,791 --> 02:52:54,540
You came asking this?

1797
02:52:54,791 --> 02:52:57,457
ls she Zaara Hayaat Khan?

1798
02:52:59,875 --> 02:53:01,707
How do you know this name?

1799
02:53:02,125 --> 02:53:06,790
She's Jehangir Hayaat
Khan's daughter from Lahore?

1800
02:53:10,875 --> 02:53:11,957
Who are you?

1801
02:53:17,625 --> 02:53:22,540
After hearing about Veer's death,
Zaara called off the marriage.

1802
02:53:25,625 --> 02:53:27,874
Abba himself got her divorced.

1803
02:53:30,208 --> 02:53:33,207
Zaara came here to help
father and Maati to make..

1804
02:53:33,291 --> 02:53:35,540
..Veer's dream come true.

1805
02:53:38,125 --> 02:53:43,790
Raza settled overseas.
Abba left politics.

1806
02:53:45,541 --> 02:53:48,207
He died two years later.

1807
02:53:50,458 --> 02:53:54,290
A few years later ma'am also died.

1808
02:53:56,625 --> 02:53:59,707
The Hayaat Khan name
no longer existed.

1809
02:54:02,541 --> 02:54:05,207
Today, father and Maati are no more.

1810
02:54:06,625 --> 02:54:10,040
But she won't go back. She says..

1811
02:54:10,791 --> 02:54:17,957
"My soul is embedded here.
Now, l'll live and die here."

1812
02:54:25,541 --> 02:54:27,457
Which century are
these people from, Shabbo?

1813
02:54:29,208 --> 02:54:33,207
There's a Veer who
so easily sacrificed..

1814
02:54:33,291 --> 02:54:35,624
..22 years of his life..

1815
02:54:36,958 --> 02:54:39,207
..to protect Zaara's honour..

1816
02:54:40,541 --> 02:54:45,207
..and there's Zaara who
spent 22 years of her life..

1817
02:54:45,291 --> 02:54:51,290
..in a strange land to
keep Veer's dream alive.

1818
02:54:54,541 --> 02:54:56,290
Are they humans
pretending to be gods..

1819
02:54:58,625 --> 02:55:00,290
..or are they gods
disguised as humans?

1820
02:55:30,625 --> 02:55:36,040
This was my mother's.

1821
02:55:39,208 --> 02:55:44,207
22 years ago, Mariam
Hayaat Khan had tied..

1822
02:55:44,291 --> 02:55:47,290
..this amulet on an lndian..

1823
02:55:47,375 --> 02:55:50,707
..while bidding him goodbye,
so that it would protect him.

1824
02:55:53,875 --> 02:55:58,457
That person did not reach
lndia but for 22 years..

1825
02:55:59,041 --> 02:56:01,290
..this charm has been
protecting him.

1826
02:56:04,875 --> 02:56:06,290
That person's name is..

1827
02:56:08,541 --> 02:56:09,874
Veer Pratap Singh.

1828
02:56:18,208 --> 02:56:23,374
He's in prison, in a jail in Lahore.

1829
02:56:25,958 --> 02:56:27,290
l am his lawyer.

1830
02:56:29,541 --> 02:56:33,290
And l've come to take you to him.

1831
02:56:44,625 --> 02:56:51,790
For the last 22 years, God has
been testing you both intensely.

1832
02:56:54,625 --> 02:56:58,874
But now, not even God can
separate Zaara and Veer.

1833
02:57:00,625 --> 02:57:04,707
Not even God can
separate Zaara and Veer.

1834
02:57:19,208 --> 02:57:23,540
Mr. Sahil Farooque, l'm asking
you where is the Defence Counsel?

1835
02:57:23,875 --> 02:57:25,624
Your Honour, she must be on her way.

1836
02:57:25,708 --> 02:57:28,040
lt seems like she has
decided to give up the case.

1837
02:57:28,125 --> 02:57:29,374
Please begin with the proceedings

1838
02:57:29,708 --> 02:57:30,874
lrresponsible..

1839
02:57:31,625 --> 02:57:34,957
Absolutely irresponsible of the
Defence Counsel not to have arrived.

1840
02:57:36,208 --> 02:57:39,040
Mr. Sahil Farooque, do
you have anything to say?

1841
02:57:39,708 --> 02:57:42,207
Your Honour, Saamiya..

1842
02:57:42,291 --> 02:57:44,374
l mean my learned
colleague should be here soon.

1843
02:57:44,958 --> 02:57:46,040
There's no problem..

1844
02:57:46,125 --> 02:57:49,124
There is a problem, Mr. Farooque.
There is a problem.

1845
02:57:51,041 --> 02:57:54,457
lt's no small matter to waste
the court's time in this manner.

1846
02:57:55,458 --> 02:57:58,207
Especially when l
had clearly specified..

1847
02:57:58,291 --> 02:58:01,207
..that this day has been
reserved for the Defence's case.

1848
02:58:01,291 --> 02:58:03,374
Then what's the reason for
her absence from the court?

1849
02:58:03,708 --> 02:58:06,790
lt's obvious that the
Defence does not have a case.

1850
02:58:07,458 --> 02:58:09,207
Silence on the defendant's
part and..

1851
02:58:09,291 --> 02:58:11,707


..no one appearing on
behalf of the Defence..

1852
02:58:30,583 --> 02:58:40,582


1853
02:59:08,541 --> 02:59:13,624
"For you, l have
lived all these days."

1854
02:59:14,125 --> 02:59:17,790
"With my lips sealed."

1855
02:59:18,375 --> 02:59:27,457
"For you, l have lived all
these days, with my unshed tears."

1856
02:59:27,791 --> 02:59:34,207
"But in my heart,
the flames of love.."

1857
02:59:34,291 --> 02:59:42,624
"..have always been
burning for you, only for you."

1858
02:59:42,875 --> 02:59:52,207
"For you, l have lived all
these days, with my unshed tears."

1859
02:59:52,625 --> 03:00:01,790
"For you, l have lived all
these days, with my lips sealed."

1860
03:00:02,208 --> 03:00:09,207
"But in my heart,
the flames of love.."

1861
03:00:09,291 --> 03:00:17,290
"..have always been
burning for you, only for you."

1862
03:00:42,125 --> 03:00:46,790
"Life has brought me.."

1863
03:00:47,208 --> 03:00:51,707
"..a volume of old times."

1864
03:00:51,958 --> 03:01:01,374
"Life has brought me a
volume of old times."

1865
03:01:01,875 --> 03:01:11,207
"And l am surrounded
by countless memories."

1866
03:01:11,541 --> 03:01:20,290
"Unasked, l have now found
all the answers l sought."

1867
03:01:20,875 --> 03:01:30,040
"Look, what l yearned
for and what l got."

1868
03:01:30,208 --> 03:01:35,374
"But in my heart,
the flames of love.."

1869
03:01:35,958 --> 03:01:45,457
"Have always been
burning for you, only for you."

1870
03:02:05,458 --> 03:02:24,790
"How can l describe the
cruelty of this world?"

1871
03:02:25,041 --> 03:02:34,374
"l was ordered to live,
but without you."

1872
03:02:34,875 --> 03:02:43,624
"lgnorant are those who say
to me that you are unknown."

1873
03:02:44,208 --> 03:02:53,374
"So many ordeals, were
heaped on me by this world."

1874
03:02:53,625 --> 03:03:00,207
"But in my heart,
the flames of love.."

1875
03:03:00,291 --> 03:03:08,207
"..have always been
burning for you, only for you."

1876
03:03:08,291 --> 03:03:13,624
"For you, l have
lived all these days."

1877
03:03:14,041 --> 03:03:17,874
"With my lips sealed."

1878
03:03:18,208 --> 03:03:27,457
"For you, l have lived all
these days, with my unshed tears."

1879
03:03:27,875 --> 03:03:39,790
"But in my heart, the flames of love,
haνe always been burning for you."

1880
03:03:39,958 --> 03:03:52,540
"Only for you."

1881
03:04:07,875 --> 03:04:10,040
Zaara Hayaat Khan's testimony..

1882
03:04:12,208 --> 03:04:17,040
..and photographs and documents
presented by her prove that..

1883
03:04:18,375 --> 03:04:23,457
..this man is not Rajesh Rathore
but that he is Veer Pratap Singh.

1884
03:04:25,291 --> 03:04:29,207
And to prevent disgracing the
honour of a Pakistani girl..

1885
03:04:29,291 --> 03:04:34,290
..Veer Pratap Singh
signed that affidavit.

1886
03:04:36,041 --> 03:04:42,707
Squadron Leader Veer Pratap Singh,
this court exonerates you.

1887
03:04:48,875 --> 03:04:54,124
Order. Order.
- Go, Veer Pratap Singh, go.

1888
03:04:55,458 --> 03:04:59,040
You have the right to return to your
country with your head held high.

1889
03:05:03,375 --> 03:05:09,040
And for the precious 22 years
of your life wasted in prison..

1890
03:05:10,041 --> 03:05:14,790
..the State of Pakistan and this
court asks for your forgiνeness.

1891
03:05:17,208 --> 03:05:20,874
lf you wish to speak, you may.

1892
03:05:40,375 --> 03:05:46,040
l, prisoner number 786..

1893
03:05:47,208 --> 03:05:49,290
..look through the bars of the jail.

1894
03:05:51,208 --> 03:05:55,040
l see days, months,
years change to eons.

1895
03:05:57,708 --> 03:06:02,790
From the soil of this land comes
the fragrance of my father's fields.

1896
03:06:05,875 --> 03:06:10,290
This burning sun reminds me
of my Maati's cool buttermilk.

1897
03:06:13,541 --> 03:06:18,207
This rain brings along with
it the swings of my seasons.

1898
03:06:19,875 --> 03:06:23,957
This winter fills me with the
warmth of the fires of my Lodi.

1899
03:06:27,625 --> 03:06:35,124
They say this is not your country
then why does it feel like mine?

1900
03:06:38,458 --> 03:06:45,040
He says l am not like him,
then why does he look like me?

1901
03:06:47,541 --> 03:06:52,457
l prisoner number 786 look
through the bars of the jail.

1902
03:06:54,541 --> 03:06:58,457
l see an angel who has
descended from heaven.

1903
03:07:00,375 --> 03:07:05,290
She calls herself
Saamiya and she calls me Veer.

1904
03:07:07,208 --> 03:07:11,957
She's a complete stranger,
but treats me as her own.

1905
03:07:13,958 --> 03:07:18,790
Hearing her truthful words,
l feel like living once more.

1906
03:07:21,208 --> 03:07:25,790
Hearing her promises and vows, l
feel like doing something more.

1907
03:07:27,958 --> 03:07:30,290
They say that she is
no one of mine then..

1908
03:07:32,375 --> 03:07:34,790
..why does she fight
the world for me?

1909
03:07:37,208 --> 03:07:43,290
He says that l'm not like her
then why does she look like me?

1910
03:07:51,208 --> 03:07:56,957
l, prisoner number 786, look
through the bars of the jail.

1911
03:08:00,041 --> 03:08:04,957
l see my Zaara wrapped in
the colours of my village.

1912
03:08:07,875 --> 03:08:12,290
ln making my dreams come true,
she has forgotten her own.

1913
03:08:13,708 --> 03:08:18,374
ln serving my people, she
has left behind her own.

1914
03:08:21,291 --> 03:08:26,290
Now, l feel like filling
her being with happiness.

1915
03:08:28,541 --> 03:08:33,540
l feel like living
another lifetime for her.

1916
03:08:36,208 --> 03:08:38,290
They say that my country
is not hers..

1917
03:08:41,791 --> 03:08:43,707
..then why is she staying
in my home?

1918
03:08:44,791 --> 03:08:50,374
He says that l'm not like her,
then why does she look like me?

1919
03:08:54,458 --> 03:08:56,457
l, prisoner number 786..

1920
03:08:59,458 --> 03:09:03,790
..look through the bars of the jail.

1921
03:09:47,208 --> 03:09:48,874
Thank you.

1922
03:09:48,958 --> 03:09:52,457
Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1923
03:09:53,791 --> 03:09:54,874
Saamiya.

1924
03:09:56,625 --> 03:09:57,790
Congratulations.

1925
03:10:00,291 --> 03:10:01,374
Thank you.

1926
03:10:05,041 --> 03:10:06,290
This was my last case.

1927
03:10:07,875 --> 03:10:10,290
l'm giving up law.

1928
03:10:12,208 --> 03:10:16,457
Because you've taught me
that l'm not fit for this work.

1929
03:10:18,458 --> 03:10:22,207
l always thought that a
country's progress is measured..

1930
03:10:22,291 --> 03:10:24,290
..by its judicial system.

1931
03:10:25,208 --> 03:10:26,790
But now, l understand that..

1932
03:10:27,208 --> 03:10:28,957
..the future of both
these countries is..

1933
03:10:29,958 --> 03:10:31,790
..in the hands of
youngsters like you.

1934
03:10:33,041 --> 03:10:38,874
Who do not measure humans as big
-small, man-woman, Hindu-Muslim..

1935
03:10:41,208 --> 03:10:44,207
Who don't rake up
bitter war memories of..

1936
03:10:44,291 --> 03:10:47,290
.. 1 947-1 965 and 1 999
on every pretext.

1937
03:10:48,541 --> 03:10:54,040
Who wish to address the future
with the truth and only the truth.

1938
03:10:55,708 --> 03:11:00,540
And there's no stopping a
country where truth prevails.

1939
03:11:04,458 --> 03:11:05,540
Thank you, Saamiya.

1940
03:11:06,458 --> 03:11:09,790
Thank you for teaching me
the value of truth and justice.

1941
03:11:13,541 --> 03:11:18,290
Your father would've been proud of
you, he would've been very proud.

1942
03:11:21,375 --> 03:11:22,457
l am.

1943
03:11:26,208 --> 03:11:27,290
Goodbye.

1944
03:12:12,625 --> 03:12:17,207
Veer had lost Zaara in Pakistan.
So, Veer and Zaara..

1945
03:12:17,291 --> 03:12:19,707
..will be joined on Pakistani soil.

1946
03:12:27,208 --> 03:12:32,957
Here, take this. Make
our Zaara yours foreνer.

1947
03:12:51,708 --> 03:12:56,624
You said, Veer and Zaara's
names can never be taken together.

1948
03:12:57,625 --> 03:13:02,374
Now, Veer and Zaara's names
haνe been joined together forever.

1949
03:13:06,958 --> 03:13:08,457
What Veer says is true.

1950
03:13:09,375 --> 03:13:13,790
You're an angel..
sent only for us by God.

1951
03:13:18,958 --> 03:13:24,040
Go ahead. Look, your
country awaits you.

1952
03:13:44,875 --> 03:13:45,957
Come, Zaara.

1953
03:13:48,458 --> 03:13:49,540
Let us go home.

1954
03:14:05,541 --> 03:14:11,874
"Gold like land, vast blue sky."

1955
03:14:12,208 --> 03:14:18,207
"Gold like land, vast blue sky,
every season is colourful."

1956
03:14:18,291 --> 03:14:32,290
"Such is my country."

1957
03:14:45,208 --> 03:15:04,207
"Lived l have for you.
Only for you."

1958
03:15:04,458 --> 03:15:09,457
"Distances between us
since ages.."

1959
03:15:10,375 --> 03:15:19,374
".. l have covered them.
Only for you."

1960
03:15:19,541 --> 03:15:38,707
"Lived l have for you.
Only for you."

1961
03:15:38,791 --> 03:15:44,040
"Distances between us
since ages.."

1962
03:15:44,625 --> 03:15:53,624
".. l have covered them.
Only for you."

1963
03:15:53,708 --> 03:16:04,624
"Only for you."
- "Only for you."

1
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,999
<i>Yes. Uh-huh.</i>

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,519
<i>I'm not kidding.</i>

3
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,879
That's where this
"class act" brought me.

4
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,959
Yeah, you heard me. Hooters.

5
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,999
This is the first date I've
been on since the divorce...

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,124
and the guy brings me to a Hooters.

7
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,599
Is Tyler asleep?

8
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,919
Oh, yeah! Whoo!

9
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,479
- Not all the way.
- What's he doing?

10
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,286
<i>This T-shirt's on fire!</i>

11
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,279
Why is he singing that?

12
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,801
Must save planet Earth.

13
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,999
No, It's all good.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,759
<i>- It's out.</i>
- What's out?

15
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,239
Oh, God, I'm coming home.

16
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,805
Intruder alert.

17
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,439
Yeah, maybe that's not
actually a bad idea.

18
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,559
Okay, here's the plan: You're
gonna call me in 10 minutes...

19
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,639
so that I can tell this
dope I have an emergency.

20
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,286
Can you give me my bath now?

21
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,804
Make it five minutes.

22
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:03,159
Got you, uh, Buffalo shrimp
with the sauce on the side.

23
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,728
They'll do that for me here.
I didn't know how you took it so...

24
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:12,039
You realize that you're not actually
looking at my face right now.

25
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,799
Very tight game going on there.
I don't wanna miss it.

26
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,085
<i>You gotta really swing the ax hard
to get those, uh, hits in deep.</i>

27
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,399
- Hi, Jim.
- Hey, Jim.

28
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,719
Hey, Jim.

29
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,399
Cheese sticks in the
shape of a heart.

30
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,570
From me, Bunny,
Bethany and Britney.

31
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,406
Thank you, Bubbles.
That's very nice.

32
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,479
- Have fun.
- See you.

33
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,125
All right.

34
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,319
Hey, I noticed that you made
eye contact with Boobies...

35
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,285
but I'm not sure it was her
eyes you were looking at.

36
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:51,439
So you organize
closets for a living.

37
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,759
Yes.

38
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:57,719
Is it hard to find people who can't organize
their own closets? How does that work?

39
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,279
Well, it's not that they
can't do it for themselves.

40
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,759
It's that they don't have the time
or they don't do it efficiently.

41
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,319
Did you start with organizing
glove compartments...

42
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,648
and just work your way
up from there or...?

43
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,159
Listen, I'm sorry. I know this
is not going well. I, heh...

44
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,761
I haven't been on a
date in 20 years.

45
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,119
I haven't been on a
date since senior year.

46
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,129
You get married in college?

47
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,087
- Yep.
- Me too.

48
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,799
- Really?
- Yes.

49
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,559
Is this not the weirdest feeling
in the world right now?

50
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:37,039
Like Weird Al starring
in <i>Weird Science.</i>

51
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,847
Yes. I like that. You
just came up with that?

52
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,839
Yes.

53
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,530
Very good.

54
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:49,359
You know, I think I will have
one of these Buffalo shrimp.

55
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,210
And I'll have it with the sauce.

56
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,647
Excellent.

57
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,201
Oh, my God.

58
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,885
Oh.

59
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,439
- It's hot.
- Oh, my God. Who makes sauce this hot?

60
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,799
I just...

61
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,639
Did you drink my beer?

62
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,159
No. No, no. I think you did.

63
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,319
Boobies! Buddy! Britney!

64
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,919
- Can you get me some water?
- Here. Have some French onion soup.

65
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,119
You know, I'm curious.

66
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,199
With so many possible reasons...

67
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,609
which one's the one
your wife left you for?

68
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,490
Cancer.

69
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,404
I'm sorry. I...

70
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,242
naturally just assumed
you were divorced.

71
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,199
It's okay.

72
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,919
I naturally assumed your
husband shot himself.

73
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,929
So we're even.

74
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,164
I gotta take this.

75
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,639
Hello.

76
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,719
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Calm down!

77
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,479
An avalanche in our backyard?

78
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,444
I'll be home right away.

79
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,568
It's an emergency. I'm sorry.

80
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,527
Twenty dollars should
cover my half.

81
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,919
<i>He used the emergency
excuse on you?</i>

82
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,559
Like he's the one
that had to escape.

83
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,199
- Like I'm so horrible.
- Huh.

84
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,959
Well, everybody has a bad blind-date
story and this loser is yours.

85
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,439
Who set you up?

86
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,839
One of the mothers
in Tyler's class.

87
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,599
Every time I see her she tells
me about her "friend Jim."

88
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,519
And, "Oh, I just have to meet Jim."

89
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,599
Well, she's a liar and an idiot.

90
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,799
You should roofie her
and shave her head.

91
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,242
Dick? Hi.

92
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,919
- No, I can talk. I'm just at work.
- Great.

93
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,202
Ha, ha. I know. I'm so sore.

94
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,484
I L word you too.

95
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,767
Okay. Talk to you later. Bye.

96
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,439
Did you just use the
L word with Dick?

97
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,199
We said it last night.

98
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,799
Jen! That's great! Why
didn't you tell me?

99
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,639
Well, you know. You finally went
on a date and it was so awful.

100
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:21,079
I didn't want to make you feel lonelier
than you probably already feel.

101
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,559
I'm fine, actually.
And I'm not lonely.

102
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,159
I have two wonderful
men in my life:

103
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,964
Brendan and Tyler.

104
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,039
Brendan needs a girlfriend
and Tyler needs Ritalin.

105
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:35,799
You're suggesting sex and drugs as a
remedy for my children's behavior.

106
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,799
Aah. Oh, my God. This is the
dress I've been wanting forever.

107
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,079
Ooh.

108
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,519
What? No.

109
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,239
- Who has that kind of money?
- Dick.

110
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,799
Try this on. This is
a total MILF dress.

111
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,209
We don't try on the clients' clothes.
It's one of our selling points.

112
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,999
"We won't wear your underwear while
we're organizing your closets."

113
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,281
I'm just saying.

114
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,999
Back to work.

115
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,559
I think right at the bottom of this rack,
we could fit some more shoes and storage...

116
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,839
Jen!

117
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,119
Kanye, come and change the baby.

118
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,639
North is wet and I don't wanna
drop her on camera again.

119
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,799
Okay. Take it off.

120
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,279
No! Look, this whole rack
still has the price tags on.

121
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,359
Technically, she hasn't taken ownership yet.
And besides, she's at the tennis club.

122
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,199
Now, try this on.

123
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,639
This dress can change a woman
from the kind a man cheats on...

124
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,599
to the kind a man cheats with.

125
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,011
I'm gonna go pee.

126
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,559
Expensive. Expensive.

127
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,649
Ooh, most expensive.

128
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,246
Wow. I didn't know you were
gonna look that good in it.

129
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,399
Oh, honey, what's wrong?

130
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,759
I should have tried harder.

131
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,919
I should have dressed sexier.

132
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:10,203
You didn't do anything
wrong. Mark is a pig.

133
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,559
But the kids don't know that.

134
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,206
Agh. They just...

135
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,839
They want us to get back together.

136
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,159
And I don't know how
to explain it to them.

137
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,119
Well, it's time for them to learn
that their dad is a big pile of crap.

138
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:28,519
I get so depressed I need
to wear high, sexy heels.

139
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,041
- Stop jogging.
- It helps.

140
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,079
It's freaking me out.

141
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,599
Look at me. I'm ridiculous.

142
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,246
Come here. Come here.

143
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,328
- Jen's got you.
- Now I see why they call you "Closet Queens."

144
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,799
- Instagram.
- Facebook.

145
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,161
- Yes!
- Yes!

146
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,239
It was awful, man. There
was no connection at all.

147
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,039
I was so happy when you came
up with the avalanche thing.

148
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,799
- That saved my life.
- Ha-ha-ha.

149
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,159
And the way she dressed was like an
assistant principal or something.

150
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,850
I felt like I was in detention.

151
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,599
- I got a girl for you.
- Yeah?

152
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,848
Blond lady. From my
belly-dancing class.

153
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,845
A little bit on the plus size.

154
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,119
But when she gets to moving, all
that flapping can make it happen.

155
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,599
- No good.
- That big girl would hit that Hooters...

156
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,725
like a hurricane. Agh! Chicken.
Steak. Fries. And a Diet Coke.

157
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,851
- All right! Gotcha!
- Ha-ha-ha.

158
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,359
I'm out, man. No
more dating for me.

159
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,799
It's time and money I should
be spending with my kids.

160
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,809
Look who it is.

161
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,759
Hey, Larry!

162
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,559
My all-star! Give me some.

163
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,445
It's Hilary, Dad,
which is bad enough.

164
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,171
You gonna leave me hanging?

165
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,639
Boom. Guess what?

166
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,639
The new Kodiak tents just arrived.

167
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,330
In time for spring break.

168
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,279
We're going camping in our
back yard again this year?

169
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,891
Why? You too old for that?

170
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:52,039
No. It's just some kids in my
class are going to Florida...

171
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:55,323
or to Colorado or even Switzerland.

172
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,119
You got a lot of rich
kids in your school.

173
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,927
- We don't got that kind of money.
- I know. It'd just be nice to go someplace.

174
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,159
You know where you could
take her that's cheap?

175
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,362
My belly-dancing class.

176
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,882
Oh. Put that away. Seriously.

177
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,522
Excuse me, sir? I'm here to
pick up my basketball uniform.

178
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,330
Did you just call me "sir"?

179
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,684
- Yeah.
- I'm a girl.

180
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,879
That's one fugly girl.

181
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,559
Hey, man, that's his daughter.

182
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,079
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

183
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,770
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Mm.

184
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,239
Hey, honey, how's the
math homework coming?

185
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,363
Are any of the tutor's
shortcuts helping?

186
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,606
Did you go on a date?

187
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,479
A date? Who told you
I went on a date?

188
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,889
You should really change your e-mail
password, little Miss 072099.

189
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,559
That is the last time I use
your birthday as a password.

190
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,159
I can't believe you
read my e-mails.

191
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,999
Brendan, I love you...

192
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,682
but we have to learn to respect
each other's privacy in this house.

193
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,559
Who's Jim?

194
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,799
Nobody, honey. A buffoon.

195
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,439
Trust me. It was nothing.

196
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,799
- You promise?
- Promise.

197
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,559
Hey! No wheels in the house!

198
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,199
- I've told you this!
- Aah!

199
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,759
Tackle him, Mom! Get him!

200
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,279
Did your dad take you for
ice cream on the way home?

201
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,439
- Spank him!
- Rocky Road and mint chocolate chip!

202
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,439
- Take him to the ground!
- I'm on top of the world! Goose, goose!

203
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,999
- Yeah.
- You're dead!

204
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,399
No more titty twisters, guys!

205
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,159
You only have two titties
for the rest of your lives!

206
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,170
We need to learn to
love and respect them.

207
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,767
I always did.

208
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,119
How many times have I told you...

209
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,439
not to pump him full of sugar
before you drop him off?

210
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:45,159
Oh, come on. Going out with
Dad for an ice cream cone...

211
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,879
is a lasting memory for a kid.

212
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,439
Oh, okay. Well, if Dad spent
more time with him...

213
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,279
then the memories wouldn't
have to be so "lasting."

214
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,239
Boom, zing. Got me again.

215
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,171
It's so great spending
time with you, Lauren.

216
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,966
That doesn't go there.

217
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,679
What are we gonna do?

218
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,319
Oh. Oh, man! It's gonna
explode in 3, 2...

219
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,521
Oh, thank God.

220
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:13,081
That was close. It was almost
unorganized for a minute.

221
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,999
- Hi.
- How are you?

222
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,439
Good. Are you going to
Tyler's game on Saturday?

223
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,371
- Yes! Of course!
- Great. I'm putting you down.

224
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,479
It's what you do best.

225
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,559
On the board, Mark. On the board.

226
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:29,003
Lauren, the boys don't need a
board. They don't need a list.

227
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,799
The know they can
count on me. That's it.

228
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,919
Dad, can you help me
with my homework?

229
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,879
Oh, I can't, bud! Sorry! I gotta
go to a thing! Ask your mom!

230
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,048
This is not an example
of my behavior.

231
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,006
Did you leave?

232
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:52,439
<i>No, oh, oh
I'll never be that girl again</i>

233
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,239
<i>No, oh, oh</i>

234
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,359
<i>My innocence is wearin' thin</i>

235
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,439
<i>But my heart is growin' strong</i>

236
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:05,799
<i>So call me, call me, call me</i>

237
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:11,000
<i>Miss movin' on
Oh, oh, oh</i>

238
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,608
- Larry, wanna shoot some hoops?
- Dad!

239
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,719
- Oh!
- Aah!

240
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,319
- Stop! Get Out!
- Oh!

241
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,999
Why wouldn't you knock?

242
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,119
I'm sorry, honey!
I didn't see anything!

243
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,999
Oh, thanks a lot!

244
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,479
No, no, no!

245
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,839
There was plenty of stuff to see!

246
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,079
Uh...

247
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:37,204
I mean, I didn't see
any gelling going on!

248
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,282
- How about a fist bump?
- No!

249
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,410
Larry, we both need this fist bump.

250
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,490
We're cool.

251
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,328
Hey, how we doing in here?

252
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,806
I'm talking to Mom.

253
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,640
Great. What are you
guys talking about?

254
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,124
It's girl stuff.

255
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,928
Okay. Well, just so you know, I'm
pretty good with girl stuff too.

256
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,445
Excuse me for a second.

257
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,319
Thanks, Dad.

258
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,284
But I just wanna talk to Mom.

259
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,361
Sure, sure.

260
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,931
Say hi for me.

261
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,439
I'm all out of stickers.

262
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,879
You're all out of face.
What happened to you? Ugh.

263
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,764
Can I play with Espn now?

264
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,122
Espn is having her quiet time.

265
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,445
Oh. With Invincible Mommy?

266
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,211
"Invisible." Yes.

267
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,999
It's not fair only
Espn gets to see her.

268
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,439
I know.

269
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,279
I wish I could see her.

270
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,766
Me too.

271
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,959
Come here. Mm.

272
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,762
Eh, eh?

273
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,479
Mac and cheese?

274
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,119
- Mac and cheese.
- Yeah!

275
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,639
I mean, he's looking around
here. Looking for you.

276
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,679
You knew it was today.
I published the calendar.

277
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,319
<i>Laur, the meeting went longer than
expected. What do you want from me?</i>

278
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:27,399
You know what? I just want you
to be a dad! I can't take it!

279
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,999
Why don't you hop over to the snack
bar, see if they sell any chill pills.

280
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,489
"Chill pills"? Why don't you
"bust a move" back to 1990.

281
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,889
You're at a baseball game?

282
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,519
I'm going on a mystery
trip with Dick.

283
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,679
That's so great.

284
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,479
I have no idea where we're going.
He's so much fun.

285
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,091
I'm so excited!

286
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:52,044
Now batting, number
23, Tyler Reynolds.

287
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,559
Okay! Come on! Go Tyler! Whoo!

288
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,159
- Come on, Tyler!
- They're putting this kid in?

289
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,119
League rule. Every kid
has to play two innings.

290
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,526
Even kids like him.

291
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,959
- You shut your piehole.
- I'll kick your ass!

292
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:08,721
- Or I'll stuff my entire fist in your mouth!
- Burt Reynolds scrawny reject!

293
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,090
Hey, how old is that pitcher?
He looks like a NASCAR driver.

294
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,359
- Strike!
- Come on!

295
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:23,239
It's okay, buddy!
Shake it off! It's okay!

296
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:26,159
Oh, no. He's not gonna have
one of his meltdowns, is he?

297
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,119
No. He has two more swings.
It's gonna be okay.

298
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,399
Okay. I better go now, then.
Oh, by the way, I need a week off.

299
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,399
Oh, yeah, sure.
When's the vacation?

300
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,965
Two weeks from today.

301
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,919
Wait. No. That's not gonna work.

302
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,249
Because that's spring break and
I've gotta take care of the boys.

303
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,199
- Strike two!
- Why?

304
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,239
It's okay, cutie, you got this!

305
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,363
Check out what happens
when this kid strikes out.

306
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,919
- You have been warned, Ratso!
- One more comment and it is go time!

307
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,122
- I will crush you!
- So checkity check it!

308
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,119
I thought Mark was taking the
kids whitewater rafting.

309
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,879
Oh, shocker. He canceled.

310
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,439
Business trip.

311
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,119
Now I'm racking my brain trying to
figure out how to compete with that.

312
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,839
You won't. There's no time.

313
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,959
And why should we
both stay at home?

314
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:12,289
You are the bestest
business partner ever. Heh.

315
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,519
- Strike three!
- I hate this!

316
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,599
I hate this! I hate this! I suck!

317
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,926
No.

318
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,081
Oh, boy. Here we go again.

319
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,447
Oh, God.

320
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,484
Maybe you should try badminton.

321
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,319
- Maybe you should try mouthwash!
- And deodorant!

322
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,439
- And some testosterone supplement!
- And some Cialis!

323
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,290
I'm just assuming!

324
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,042
And shave your neck!

325
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,405
It's very hairy.

326
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,079
God.

327
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,206
What?

328
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,245
Ugh.

329
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,161
No.

330
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,491
Damn it.

331
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:11,083
<i>Rip that little loop off the back
of your shirt. And Step Three...</i>

332
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,799
- Daddy?
- Yes.

333
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,651
What do you miss about Mommy?

334
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:20,444
What do I miss about Mommy?

335
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,805
Hmm.

336
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,247
Everything.

337
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,251
I miss her laugh.

338
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,245
And her smile.

339
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,239
And I miss her little nose
that she gave to you.

340
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,919
Luckily you didn't get mine.
You'd look very weird.

341
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,039
- Heh.
- Yeah.

342
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:42,961
I miss every time <i>The
Wizard of Oz</i> was on.

343
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,599
- I love that movie.
- I know.

344
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,599
She would sing all the songs to us.

345
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,565
Especially "Somewhere
Over the Rainbow."

346
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,607
You know what I miss
most about her?

347
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,565
What?

348
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,846
Getting to tell her
how much I love her.

349
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,370
Are you allowed to do
that with anyone else?

350
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,048
Am I allowed?

351
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,883
Your mother, before she left...

352
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,802
that's all she would talk about,
was me finding somebody else.

353
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:23,165
But I would tell her I can't
because she's my one and only.

354
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,644
What did Mommy say?

355
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,199
Your mom would say...

356
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:34,167
my heart is so big that
it has room for two.

357
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,409
That's another thing I
miss about your mother.

358
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,804
She actually thought I was awesome.

359
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,002
I think you're awesome, Daddy.

360
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,519
Thank you.

361
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,279
Hey, Dad? Um...

362
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,999
I have a personal errand to run,
and I need to borrow the car.

363
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,999
Well, you can't drive
without me yet...

364
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,719
and somebody's got to stay
here with your sisters.

365
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:03,119
Dad, I have a personal errand.

366
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,679
What does that even mean?
You taking a hit out on somebody?

367
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:09,531
Dad, she's monsterating.

368
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,999
- What?
- I have my period!

369
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,204
Oh. I forgot you get those.

370
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,369
"Tampax Pearls."

371
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,879
Douches. "Fresh Scent."

372
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:25,119
"Medicated" and "Sweet Romance."

373
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,689
Yeah, let's not be doing the
Sweet Romance douches quite yet.

374
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,562
"Poise Feminine Wash."

375
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,407
"Poise"? That's a
little close, guys.

376
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,565
"Always Clean"?

377
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,846
I could actually use those. Uh...

378
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,930
What's a Diva Cup?
Is that to make coffee?

379
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,970
I don't under...

380
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,609
What kind do you guys use?

381
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,930
Huh.

382
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,360
- No!
- Hi.

383
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,645
Don't tell me.

384
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,124
- Lauren.
- Lauren.

385
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,039
Mr. Hooters.

386
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,519
Jim.

387
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,963
What's going on in the sweater?
Just for the articles?

388
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:27,802
No. These, um, actually
are for my son.

389
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,971
Wow. What a progressive mother.

390
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:36,644
No. I found a centerfold under
his bed, and I tore it up.

391
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,519
From a magazine, not the Internet?

392
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,719
He's old school. I respect that.

393
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,285
Why'd you tear it up?

394
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,000
Because as a woman I
was totally offended.

395
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:49,245
You don't have to be. It's a
normal part of growing up.

396
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:55,399
Okay, but he taped a picture of
our babysitter's face on it.

397
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,559
Okay, that's sick. He needs help.

398
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,359
Borderline Dahmer situation.

399
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,439
Oh, very funny. Okay, but if you
had kids you'd understand...

400
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,802
- Three daughters.
- ...it's complicated.

401
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,599
You have three daughters?

402
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,771
Yes. Do you have any other
children, or just the masturbator?

403
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,239
He has a younger brother.

404
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,602
Uh-huh. Maybe you'll do a
better job with that kid.

405
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,200
I'm just joking. So what, you're here
to replace it before the kid finds out?

406
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:25,879
Yes. But I can't tell what
magazine it's from. I just...

407
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,367
Do you have any of the
centerfold remnants?

408
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,771
Yes, I do.

409
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:38,399
I, um... I tried to
tape it back up.

410
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,602
Did a great job.
You can hardly tell.

411
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,919
Snapper magazine.

412
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,119
How can you tell?

413
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,319
From the staple placement and
the way the paper feels...

414
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,729
and I already have this copy at home.
How about a fist bump? Huh?

415
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,690
Ah.

416
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,130
- Yep, that's the one.
- Great.

417
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,679
Excuse me. Actually, I thought of
something that might help us both...

418
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,199
to save us some embarrassment.

419
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:10,007
How about I bring that up to the
cashier, and you bring this up for me.

420
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,159
- Whoa. Are these for your daughter?
- Yeah. She's 15.

421
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,931
And her "friend" just paid a visit.

422
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:21,399
Okay. Well, these are for
a much older "friend."

423
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:25,639
A much heavier "friend" staying
in a much bigger "room"...

424
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,729
than your daughter has.

425
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,999
You lost me.

426
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,519
You found me. Oh.

427
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,799
- Can I get a bump?
- No.

428
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,570
No.

429
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,639
Okay. So you will do this.

430
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,039
That'll be $13.

431
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,765
Hi, I'm Tom.

432
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:46,240
- Here's your change.
- Hi, I'm Tom.

433
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,688
Yeah, you told me. Next.

434
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,639
Oh.

435
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,199
I remember the Slender Fit days.

436
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,084
You must be doing your Kegels.

437
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,803
Nowadays, I need six of
these taped together.

438
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,885
Okay. Moving on.

439
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,929
And we got...

440
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:08,081
that and card.

441
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,199
Rockin' Saturday night, huh, Lefty?

442
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,165
Oh, that's not mine.
That's for her kid.

443
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,729
Ooh, pretty progressive mom.

444
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,519
- Yeah. That's what I said to her too.
- Why would you do that?

445
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,799
- I'm sorry. I'll get you out of it.
- What is wrong with you?

446
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:27,482
She just takes her homeschooling
real serious, so that's why...

447
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,086
We get those back?

448
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:34,166
She's gotta get home to the
kid and get him going.

449
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:37,407
- Take care.
- Yeah.

450
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,570
Hi, I'm Tom.

451
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:43,119
Ugh, thanks a lot for
selling me out back there.

452
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,999
Oh, she didn't even hear about...

453
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,639
- I panicked. I'm sorry. Here.
- Oh, I noticed.

454
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,799
Thank you.

455
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:52,129
I can't believe you
have three girls.

456
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:56,320
- What does that even mean?
- I just can't imagine you with three girls.

457
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:57,521
Don't, then.

458
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,327
I'm sorry. What are their names?

459
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,571
Hilary, Lou and Espn.

460
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,479
- "Espin." That's unique.
- Mm-hm.

461
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,841
Is it Biblical?

462
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,763
No. Named after my
favorite network.

463
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,479
ESPN.

464
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,239
- No.
- Yep.

465
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,999
- What?
- Heh.

466
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,239
Pretty cool.

467
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,039
Oh, my God.

468
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,891
Your wife must have been a saint.

469
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,999
She was.

470
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,568
Your husband must have been
very patient dealing with...

471
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,839
Ah.

472
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:43,119
Another charming sentiment
from Captain Cheese Sticks.

473
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,439
You know what? Hooters is too good
for you. I'd never bring you there again.

474
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:50,479
Well, then I guess I'll just have to learn
to get through life without Hooters.

475
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,251
You've been doing a pretty
damn good job so far!

476
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:58,601
- That doesn't make any sense.
- I didn't realize they were that big.

477
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,883
Oh, whatever.

478
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,039
Guys, unfortunately your dad had
a business trip that came up...

479
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:24,119
so your whitewater rafting trip is
gonna get postponed till this summer.

480
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,799
- What?
- We're stuck here doing nothing all week?

481
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,719
I have plans. I have
great plans actually.

482
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,810
Like what? Bowling and
going to the mall?

483
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,199
How did you know?

484
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,291
- Bet that's Dad!
- Maybe he'll take us on his business trip!

485
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:44,439
- Oh, hey. Is your mom home?
- What do you mean "Is your mom home"?

486
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,961
- Who are you?
- I'm Jim.

487
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:51,086
Jim? Jim66@DSG.com?

488
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:54,159
What is this, <i>Dateline NBC?</i>
Yes, you got it right.

489
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,599
- What do you want?
- I need to talk to your mother.

490
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,439
- Not a big deal.
- She said she's not interested in you.

491
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,599
Believe me, Frodo, I don't like her either.
I have to sort something out with her.

492
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,963
- Brendan, honey, who's at the...?
- Hey.

493
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:10,839
- Jim.
- You lied! Liar! You like him!

494
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:13,599
What? I didn't lie, honey.
He's a buffoon.

495
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,519
- Just like I said.
- Don't talk to me!

496
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,759
Ever!

497
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:19,645
No, sweetie, come on.

498
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:23,199
- What?
- Great.

499
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,239
Which one was the masturbator?
The big one?

500
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,799
Why are you here? What do you want?

501
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,439
The old bag at the pharmacy
mixed up our cards.

502
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:33,239
That's impossible because I
keep my cards very organized.

503
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,959
I keep them in
color-coded sleeves...

504
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,559
All right, I'll give this back to
whoever it belongs to. Lauren Reynolds.

505
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:41,684
- You know her? Have you met her?
- Oh.

506
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:46,170
God, I don't know what's wrong with me
lately. I feel like I'm losing my mind.

507
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,839
Just come in.

508
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,439
So wait. How do you
know where I live?

509
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:54,079
I Googled you and "Closet
Queens" came up.

510
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,204
- You're a lesbian?
- No.

511
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:03,319
We organize "closets" and we're
the best, so we're "queens."

512
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,681
"Closet Queens."

513
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,447
Maybe the picture was confusing me.

514
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,041
What picture?

515
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,519
Ugh, those little weasels.

516
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,199
Your girlfriend, like, does
she know we went on a date?

517
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,359
Is she gonna kill me?
She looks nuts.

518
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,039
- Lauren!
- Well, here she is.

519
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:25,839
- I have to talk to you!
- I never touched her. She repulses me.

520
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,519
- What?
- What?

521
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,839
Jen, what's wrong?

522
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,839
- It's over between me and Dick.
- Over?

523
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,849
I thought you don't like dick.

524
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,959
But you guys just started
using the L word.

525
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,279
The <i>L Word.</i> I saw that show.
You guys love that one I'm guessing.

526
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,919
I'm sorry. Who are you?
Are you here to fix something?

527
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:46,283
- You should probably go and do that.
- I'm Jim. I'm not a threat.

528
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,879
- Jim?
- The blind-date guy.

529
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,839
- You said that was a disaster.
- Oh, it was.

530
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,679
You said he was a chubby loser.

531
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,879
He is.

532
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:00,399
You didn't mention he has that high phlegmy
voice like he drinks a lot of dairy.

533
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,239
- I know.
- Standing right here, ladies.

534
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,559
Hearing everything.

535
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:06,799
All right, our cards got switched
so we're just dealing with that.

536
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,479
What happened with Dick?

537
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,799
He just dropped a major bomb on me.

538
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,239
He's married.

539
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,011
No, worse. He's got kids.

540
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,160
Oh, you're still here. Why?

541
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:24,239
You still have my card. "Why?"

542
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:29,039
Wait. You're just gonna break up
with him because he has children?

543
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:32,239
Five children. Five.

544
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,839
What am I, Julie Andrews?

545
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,203
I'm gonna sew matching outfits
and sing to escape the Nazis?

546
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:40,199
He asked me if I wanted
to be "part of the team."

547
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,439
- No, I don't!
- Maybe you should just go on the trip...

548
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,371
and, you know, spend some
alone time with Dick.

549
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,439
See, he wanted the
kids to come with us.

550
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:51,919
He wanted me to get to know them in
a "fun and neutral environment."

551
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:55,283
Eh, five kids? Is his
last name Theodopolis?

552
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,326
- Yes.
- That's incredible. That's my boss.

553
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:02,879
He owns all the Dick's Sporting Goods.
I manage the one in Ridgefield.

554
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,082
Of course you do.

555
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:09,359
Dick takes a lot of special needs people,
makes them "managers" of something...

556
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,131
so they can have a business
card and feel important.

557
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,919
Good for you!

558
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,279
That explains it.
That explains a lot.

559
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:19,039
You know, actually I applied
to work at Closet Queens...

560
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:22,279
but they said there's already a
gorilla filling that position.

561
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,239
It's a thyroid thing.

562
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,959
- Heh.
- Where was he gonna take you?

563
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,321
Africa.

564
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,639
It was gonna be incredible.
Look at that.

565
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,319
- Sun, sand, safaris.
- Wow.

566
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,490
- Oh, my God.
- He must really like you a lot.

567
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,319
Sorry, I'm not getting it at all.

568
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,807
Okay. And this concludes
our business.

569
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,719
Thank you. Africa.

570
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:49,319
So he's just gonna go here all
by himself with his kids now?

571
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:53,239
No. He's heartbroken now.
Nobody gets to go.

572
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,771
Oh, damn it!

573
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:59,199
Why does he have to have joint custody?
I thought the mother always got the kids.

574
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,679
I mean, this is a week away.
I hope he gets his money back.

575
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:05,439
- A week out? Not a chance.
- Aah!

576
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,879
Well, maybe they do things
differently in Africa.

577
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:11,279
I forgot you were an expert at
closets and African refund policies.

578
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:14,768
Okay. Kick him out. Don't let
him talk to you like that.

579
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,969
- Get out.
- I'm leaving.

580
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:22,959
Jen. My boys would give anything
to go on a vacation like this.

581
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,479
Mr. Theodopolis. Hi.
It's Jim Friedman.

582
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:30,959
I don't mean to be a vulture picking on
the carcass of your dead relationship.

583
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,279
But I wonder...

584
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,199
if you'd sell me the vacation...

585
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,839
you were gonna go on with
Freddy Krueger's sister?

586
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:40,639
I have been saving and saving. I could
never give him full value for it...

587
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,799
but something's better
than nothing, right, sir?

588
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,519
It would just be the three of us.

589
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:47,199
It would just be the four of
us so we only need one room.

590
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,839
Oh, my God. Wait until
I tell the boys.

591
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:53,039
Wait till I tell the girls!

592
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,279
We're going to Africa!

593
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,599
<i>Welcome to Africa</i>

594
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,689
<i>Welcome, welcome</i>

595
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,759
I can't believe we're here.

596
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,479
This is pretty cool, Mom.

597
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,839
Yeah.

598
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:22,559
<i>Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome</i>

599
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:27,399
So I did good? This is better
than, like, bowling and the mall?

600
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,170
Oh, yeah.

601
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:38,919
<i>- Welcome, welcome
- Africa!</i>

602
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:42,679
Thank you so much. Thank you.
This is terrific. This is great.

603
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,039
What the fu...?

604
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,879
- Brendan!
- What the fudge is he doing here?

605
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,599
We're going on family
vacations together now?

606
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:54,486
I have no idea why they
followed us to Africa.

607
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,007
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

608
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:03,239
Is this a sick dream? What
is happening right now?

609
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,639
You're stalking my mom!
You're a predator!

610
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:08,759
Hey! Don't talk to my dad
like that, butthole!

611
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:11,279
- Language!
- How about you don't correct my daughter?

612
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,439
She can say "butthole"
if she wants to.

613
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,079
- Butthole! Butthole!
- Not you.

614
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:18,841
I hear thunder on the
mountain. Ha-ha-ha.

615
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:23,527
Welcome to South Africa.
Mfana at your service.

616
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:24,919
Mfana.

617
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:28,319
Uh, Jim. I mean, Dick.

618
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,959
Dick Theodopolis.

619
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,599
Welcome, Dick Theodopolis!

620
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:36,442
And you are traveling with one
little girl and two, uh...

621
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:42,410
- Big girls.
- Ha-ha-ha. Of course.

622
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,841
And you must be...

623
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,079
Miss Palmer.

624
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,519
Yes. Jen Palmer.

625
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,119
Oh, I see what you did.

626
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,959
I see what you did too.

627
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:55,199
Are you ready for the most exciting,
amazing, and romantic week...

628
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,279
of your entire lives?

629
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,529
<i>Exciting, amazing, romantic!</i>

630
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:05,368
Yeah, we're here for the
zero romance package.

631
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:08,159
You still haven't told the
children, my friends?

632
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,599
Told the children what?

633
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,919
- Do I have a new mommy?
- Mfana.

634
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:15,519
Will you do us a favor?
Leave us alone for just two secs.

635
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:19,199
- Which means "of course."
- Thank you.

636
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:23,079
All right. Listen. Would you just
reassure my son that we're not dating.

637
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,639
We are not dating! I promise you.

638
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:28,889
This is not a face I want to
wake up to every morning.

639
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,559
Wow.

640
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,799
You'd be lucky to wake up to that
every day. My mom is frigging hot.

641
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,639
Did you just say your mom was hot?

642
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,279
No! Not hot...!

643
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,369
That's just wrong.

644
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,919
- Tyler! Tyler!
- Whoo!

645
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,839
- Get down from there!
- Wee!

646
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:47,399
Oh, God! Please, please,
please, please get down!

647
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,887
- Whoo!
- Aah!

648
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,439
This place is ginormous!

649
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,759
Oh, my God!

650
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,486
Follow me. Right this way.

651
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,919
Welcome to your familymoon.

652
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,201
Whoa.

653
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,808
This is so cool.

654
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:07,199
Now we're talking!
This is Africa, baby!

655
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,439
We'll take this room.

656
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,639
No! We want this room.

657
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:15,129
Silly Theocropolises!
This is for the children.

658
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:20,284
This room is for the
mama and the papa.

659
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,879
Look at that bed.

660
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,605
- Huge.
- Awesome.

661
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,239
- This is so cool.
- Look at this candy.

662
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,999
Here is where you make
more Theopotamuses.

663
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,851
My bad.

664
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,439
What part of "not dating"
does this bed fit into?

665
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:41,039
- Oh, boy.
- Okay. You know what?

666
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,799
Everybody fall into line.

667
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,279
Brendan, Tyler honey,
I need you on the couch.

668
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,199
Hilary, C-SPAN, Lou...

669
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,759
Espn, Espn.

670
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,559
Excuse me. Espn. I'm sorry, honey.

671
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,119
Oh, my God.

672
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:59,559
Dick was gonna propose to Jen.
A family honeymoon, a "familymoon."

673
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:02,439
And your dumb friend ruined it.
Here's what's gonna happen.

674
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,359
The first room we saw,
we're gonna take that.

675
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:07,959
And you and your deranged boys can
have Wilt Chamberlain's headquarters.

676
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,924
Dude, what are you eating?

677
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,006
Mm. "Cherry Pan-ties."

678
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:16,208
What are "Cherry Pan-ties"?
Let me see that.

679
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,199
- Oh, no! God! Spit it out! Spit it out!
- Why?

680
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:23,079
Just no Cherry Pan-ties ever!
Out, out, out!

681
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:26,409
Hey, Mom. I guess this
used to be a firehouse.

682
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,999
Look at this place. Wow.

683
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,479
Hello, Mr. Snuffleupagus.

684
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,444
Heh. Theodopolis.

685
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,205
Hello...

686
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,839
Girls.

687
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:53,399
- Girls. They're girls.
- That's twice.

688
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,568
Let's go, guys... Girls.

689
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,799
23. We're looking for 23.

690
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,729
There it is.

691
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,039
- Ahem.
- Oh.

692
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,239
- Hi!
- Hey.

693
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,759
How you doing? I think we're
sharing a table with you.

694
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:15,204
Yeah. Hi! I'm Eddy Wernick and this
is Ginger Wernick and our son, Jake.

695
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,959
We're from Vancouver.

696
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,679
Okay. I'm your son. All right?

697
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:22,719
Ginger would've had to give birth to
me when she was 6. She's not my mom.

698
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,639
Okay. Get it out
there for everyone.

699
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,839
Sharing it, loving it.
No holding back. That's good.

700
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:31,719
- All right. Let's do our thing. Come on.
- Isn't this place fantastic?

701
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,839
- So romantic.
- Oh.

702
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,963
Good. Gonna have a nice trip here.

703
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,039
- Um, Dad?
- Hey, sweetie.

704
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,399
Where should I sit?

705
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,999
You can sit anywhere you want.

706
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,521
What about Mom? Where does she sit?

707
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,844
Uh, where do you want her to sit?

708
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,439
Next to me?

709
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,799
Then that's where
she'll sit. Go ahead.

710
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,519
Get right next to Lou.
Your mom's right there.

711
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,999
Okay?

712
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,850
All good.

713
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,161
Ignoring it. Ignoring
the weirdness.

714
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,806
Ah.

715
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,239
Where's the funeral at, boys?

716
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,199
Where's the golf
tournament at, girls?

717
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,599
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.

718
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,279
Mfana. Mfana!

719
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,599
Yes! Missus, uh...?

720
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:14,999
Reynolds. Palmer!
Just not his wife, okay?

721
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,039
I don't wanna sit here.
Not gonna happen.

722
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,759
Ha, ha. I'm afraid it
must happen, ma'am.

723
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:23,279
All tables are filled and
this is your family.

724
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,766
Please sit with us.

725
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,724
You give it a try.

726
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,119
Every family fights.

727
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,919
- You make it better.
- Mm-hm.

728
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,119
- Yes?
- Yes.

729
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,845
Try the chakalaka.

730
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,759
- Hi, new people.
- Hello.

731
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:42,841
This is Lauren, by the way, and her children,
the karate kids: Wax On and Wax Off.

732
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:47,039
Isn't this place fantastic?

733
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,766
Oh, it's so romantic.

734
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,971
Sorry, what'd you say?

735
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,363
So romantic!

736
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,679
Easy.

737
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,399
Keeping it classy, huh, Ginger?

738
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,728
Oh, Jakey, you have
something on your face.

739
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,564
Oh, it's a mole.

740
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,279
Hey! You can't sit there.

741
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,448
- Why not?
- My mom's sitting there.

742
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:13,522
- Is she in the bathroom or something?
- No. She's sitting there right now.

743
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,599
Are you on meds?

744
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,799
Ow!

745
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:21,083
It's okay, Espn. We'll get
Brendan another chair.

746
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,999
Thank you.

747
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,839
Whatever. I'm just gonna
go to the buffet.

748
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,479
Tyler, come with me. They eat
fried caterpillars here.

749
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,045
Hell, yeah!

750
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,759
Very nice. Girls, why don't
you hit the buffet also?

751
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:36,519
Larry, make sure you have plenty of beef,
okay? Gotta bulk up for the season.

752
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,085
Love you. Go on.

753
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,926
"Bulk up for the season"?
What is she, a bear?

754
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:48,599
She's trying out for girls' varsity this
year. A lot of big ladies out there.

755
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:52,039
- She's gonna eat her way into the starting five.
- My God.

756
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:57,404
Hello, everybody!

757
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:00,359
My name is Nickens.

758
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:03,799
And we are Thathoo!

759
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,159
We play traditional South African
<i>isicathamiya</i> music...

760
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:13,968
with a little bit of American soul.

761
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:19,039
- Ha-ha-ha!
- It is getting a little hot in here.

762
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:24,399
Finally, my huge
African arms are free.

763
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,204
Yeah, baby!

764
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,160
Yes, they are.

765
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,599
No.

766
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:32,679
I would like to
welcome you to our...

767
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:36,680
Fourth Annual Blended
Familymoon Week!

768
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,959
- What's a blended family?
- I don't know. It sounds painful, though.

769
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:47,159
I am looking out at
all you beautiful...

770
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:50,599
stepchildren, stepdads, stepmoms...

771
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:55,359
half-brothers, same-sex domestic
partners, and good old-fashioned...

772
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:57,839
booty calls gone wrong. Ha-ha-ha.

773
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:03,879
Now, even though the
emphasis is on family...

774
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:07,599
we here at the beautiful Sun
City Resort want to make sure...

775
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:11,679
you get some alone time.

776
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:14,087
Oh...

777
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:19,559
Because alone time can
sometime take a long time...

778
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:23,651
we have many supervised activities
for the young ones to do.

779
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:27,559
<i>We have a fabulous
jungle play zone.</i>

780
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:35,485
<i>A nightly pool party.</i>

781
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:40,120
Hey, Espn. Why aren't you getting in?
Is your mom afraid of the water?

782
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,006
Good one, Mom.

783
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:47,039
<i>Magical animal time.</i>

784
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:51,848
Little one, wouldn't you like
to try petting a living animal?

785
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:54,403
He's dead?

786
00:42:55,960 --> 00:43:00,599
<i>And our famous Tekula teen disco!</i>

787
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:08,007
Hey, dude. There's a lot
of hot chicks out here.

788
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,639
The best time.

789
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,129
What the heck is...?

790
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,205
What is that?

791
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,091
Are you kidding me?

792
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,879
Oh, my God! Are you kidding me?

793
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,919
Oh, my God! Oh, God!

794
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:41,119
Oh, God! Crocodile!

795
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,639
Crocodile attack!

796
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:45,279
Help me! Somebody help me!

797
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,926
Please don't kill me!
God! Oh, my God!

798
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:53,887
Mr. Bellyflopolis, the
crocodiles are fake!

799
00:43:58,080 --> 00:43:59,805
They're fake?

800
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:02,009
Yes, they're fake!

801
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:06,559
Why would you make
them look so realistic?

802
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,839
Well, to scare the baboons away.

803
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:14,719
You just scared a zebra
stripe into my underwear!

804
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:18,959
Don't worry! What happens
in Africa, stays in Africa.

805
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:28,119
Oh. Oh.

806
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:30,084
Tyler. Okay.

807
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,279
Excuse me. Oh.

808
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,527
Okay.

809
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:42,639
That's one way to get him
to sleep through the night.

810
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,759
- You saw that?
- I actually heard it.

811
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,479
I think they heard it in Uganda.

812
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:48,559
It was a lot easier
when he was Lou's age.

813
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:51,439
Of course, let me help you out here.
Here you are. You're home.

814
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,279
- Thank you.
- Absol... Oh. Too late.

815
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,479
- Aah!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

816
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:58,399
All right, all right, all right.
Pick him up.

817
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,719
Three-second rule.
Three-second rule.

818
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:03,321
Good, good, good.
You're fine. He's fine.

819
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,923
Okay, now I'm getting scared.

820
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,570
Okay.

821
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,528
Sleep, sleep.

822
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:33,203
Too hot in here.
No blanket, okay? Shh.

823
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:35,924
Here's your buddy.

824
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,603
Love ya, love ya.

825
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:46,123
Mom's sleeping there.

826
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:48,484
Okay, can I sleep with her?

827
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,525
No, you'll crush her.

828
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:54,243
No, I could get in with her and
spoon with her. It would be nice.

829
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:58,007
- I don't wanna see that.
- No. Okay.

830
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:02,047
We'll let Mommy rest.
I'll, uh... I'll figure it out.

831
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,359
I love you.

832
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:06,086
- I love you too, Dad. Good night.
- Sleep good.

833
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:10,999
Me and you there, shorty.

834
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,407
Okay, that's right.

835
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:18,567
Right on my neck. That's gonna
make a nice evening for me.

836
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:42,890
Hey, guys. It is time to wake up.

837
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:47,039
Africa awaits us. It's
a beautiful morning.

838
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:50,767
- Is he crazy?
- Go away. It's way too early.

839
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:54,171
Lou, will you wake up
with Daddy, please?

840
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:58,087
In the name of
Lucifer, let us sleep.

841
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:04,085
Up, up, up, you two.
I have quite a day planned.

842
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,531
I need a coffee.

843
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:15,965
Morning.

844
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:19,479
- Big day planned?
- Oh, yeah.

845
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:24,159
7:15 nature walk. 8:30 petting zoo.
10:00 a.m. native crafts.

846
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:26,599
The boys, they're so excited.

847
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:30,079
Really? My girls are ecstatic also.
Just jumping up and down on the bed.

848
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:31,439
Can't believe they're here.

849
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,639
- Cream?
- No, thank you.

850
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:37,003
- Sugar?
- Yes, please.

851
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:41,279
- Couldn't get the boys out of bed?
- No.

852
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,479
The girls?

853
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:45,399
The girls are probably
sleeping the rest of the trip.

854
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:49,127
Possible exorcism coming for the
little one. We'll see what happens.

855
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,679
Well, it's beautiful here.

856
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,211
Oh, yeah.

857
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:02,530
- I'll see you around.
- Yeah. Have a good one.

858
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,880
You won't see that in New Jersey.

859
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:12,039
Okay. All right. All right. Here we go.
Okay. Here you go, baby.

860
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:14,719
That's it, sweetie. Take him down.
Take him! That's it.

861
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:17,002
Back him. Use your weight!
Muscle him.

862
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:19,079
- Unh.
- Use your body.

863
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:21,806
- Unh!
- Oh, yeah! Finish it!

864
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,851
- Ugh!
- And bam! That's it! Yes!

865
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,168
Yes! Way to go, Larry.

866
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:33,479
Winners up. Let's go.
Give me the ball. Buddy.

867
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:35,125
Up top.

868
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:39,559
And we go in. Let's go. Get loose.

869
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:42,684
Cut. Cut! Larry! Move!

870
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,849
Come on. What are you doing?

871
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:49,799
Larry?

872
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:51,959
Just cut! Go! Break it.

873
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:53,889
Shake him off. Come on.

874
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,206
Are you voguing right now?

875
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,731
What is happening?

876
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:00,725
Here! Just take the ball.

877
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:03,359
Work the kid. Work him. Lose him.

878
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:06,279
Cross him. Cross him over.
Cross him.

879
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:07,879
Don't skip!

880
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:09,879
Why you moving like that?
Is it the bra?

881
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:13,209
Because if it's the bra, just take it off.
You don't need it anyways.

882
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:21,521
What?

883
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:26,559
What are you doing?
We just started.

884
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:29,331
Is your boy okay? Why
does he wear a bra?

885
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:31,206
She's a girl.

886
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:34,719
You suck.

887
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,879
<i>You suck, you suck, you suck</i>

888
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:39,003
<i>You suck, you suck, you suck</i>

889
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:42,239
<i>You suck, you suck, you suck
You schooled by a little girl</i>

890
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,920
<i>Your boy has no skills</i>

891
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:49,250
<i>You schooled by a little girl</i>

892
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:01,964
Tyler, slow down!

893
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:05,399
Come on, Mom! We're going
four miles per hour.

894
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:08,519
That's plenty fast enough.
Fast and safe.

895
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:11,159
Miss Palmer! It's okay to go fast.

896
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:12,919
Oh, okay, Mfana.

897
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:14,759
Watch me!

898
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:17,279
Ha-ha-ha. Wee!

899
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,959
- You're going the wrong way!
- Watch out, Grandma!

900
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:24,726
My bad.

901
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:29,279
The blending process is
really going well for us.

902
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:34,239
My husband's 13-year-old still has
some hatred issues towards me.

903
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:37,959
But it is becoming less
physical, so it's a start.

904
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:40,638
- That's great.
- Good for you.

905
00:50:40,639 --> 00:50:44,599
I woke up this morning with a
pillow pressed against my face.

906
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:48,639
But I could sense some guilt
afterwards. So that's progress.

907
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:52,039
Hang in there, ladies. There's a
light at the end of the tunnel.

908
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:53,839
This little angel here...

909
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:57,879
is finally starting to think
of me as her second mom.

910
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:00,447
Not just her former
gymnastics teacher.

911
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,444
What are you drawing, honey?

912
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:06,048
It's a picture of elephants stomping
on your head and making you dead.

913
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,608
- Heh-heh-heh.
- Stop it.

914
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,680
Don't worry. What happens
in Africa stays in Africa.

915
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:16,439
Bump my fist?

916
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:19,371
- Ha, ha. Jim's so funny.
- Yeah.

917
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:37,079
My head is boiling,
Mom. Get it off.

918
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:38,361
I'm trying.

919
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:42,199
- Why did you tie it with so many knots?
- I didn't want it to come flying off.

920
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:45,279
Oh, my God! What
happened to her face?

921
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:48,679
- I painted it. She's a kitty cat.
- Are you wearing eye shadow?

922
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:52,119
I made Daddy a princess,
but he washed the paint off.

923
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:55,679
Well, not all the way off because
he looks a little like Lady Gaga.

924
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:59,646
Why is this kid wearing a helmet? Are you
carrying him to bed again or something?

925
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:03,359
No, I tied the chin strap too
many times. I can't get it off.

926
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:07,199
Best thing about working at a sporting
goods store: Swiss Army knives.

927
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,209
- Just be careful.
- I'll go easy.

928
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:11,959
- Aah!
- Oh.

929
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:14,199
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
- Thank you.

930
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:17,199
- Daddy, I gotta go to the bathroom.
- You do? Okay.

931
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,765
Can she take me?

932
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:22,799
She's got her own life to live.
What do you gotta do? One or two?

933
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:25,446
- Number one.
- I can handle this.

934
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:27,919
- Okay.
- Will you watch him?

935
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:31,839
- And I mean watch him.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got it, home slice.

936
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:33,079
- Okay.
- For sure.

937
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:35,079
What's number one again?

938
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:37,123
It's a pee-pee.

939
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:42,081
And sometimes he wipes too hard.

940
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,479
I'm sure he doesn't mean to.

941
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:48,287
No, he's a good daddy.
He just doesn't have a bagina.

942
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,959
Okay, honey. Let's wash your hands.

943
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:58,559
He's a bad daddy! He made me
look like the walking dead!

944
00:52:58,560 --> 00:52:59,759
Oh, no!

945
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:03,279
Okay.

946
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:04,839
All right.

947
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:07,679
Let's see what we have
in the magic bag here.

948
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:10,599
Oh. Perfect.

949
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:12,962
All right. La, da, da.

950
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:15,966
You're pretty.

951
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:19,444
You're prettier.

952
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,645
I said you are.

953
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:25,119
Shut up and let me do your makeup.

954
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:28,279
Don't worry. They're around.

955
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:29,879
Oh, I'm not worried.

956
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:31,605
Maybe that's where they are.

957
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:33,806
Yeah!

958
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:35,959
Yeah!

959
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:37,286
Tyler?

960
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:39,241
- Hold on, now!
- Excuse me.

961
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:42,119
- Hold on, big time!
- Aah!

962
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:49,119
Aah! Oh, my God!
I'm gonna kill him.

963
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,239
Yeah, baby! Hold on, now!

964
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:54,799
Whoa! Whoa!

965
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,923
Easy, homey, easy!

966
00:53:57,160 --> 00:54:01,319
Tyler! Get off that
dodo bird right now!

967
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:05,491
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Everything's fine.
The safety instructor's on top of it.

968
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:09,399
Ugh.

969
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:12,524
Look at me, Mom! I'm a cowboy!

970
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:15,079
Well, partner, I bet I can
stay on longer than you!

971
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:16,759
It's on, sheriff.

972
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:18,883
No "longer"! No "staying"!

973
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:22,119
- I can't be beat!
- I can't hear you! You're going down!

974
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:25,722
I'm never gonna fall off! Never!

975
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,719
Whoo! One hand, mama!

976
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,046
Whoo... Aah!

977
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:37,199
Ooh!

978
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:38,359
Good!

979
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:41,564
Yes! I win! I'm the king of Africa!

980
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:45,879
- Whoa!
- Tyler!

981
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:51,039
A winner!

982
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,599
Are you kidding me?

983
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:54,919
Yee-haw! Yee-haw!

984
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:57,999
Wow. Whoo, boom!

985
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,879
You're a moron, okay? Because
he could've broken his neck!

986
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:05,199
Mom. Mom, Mom. Did you see that?
I stuck the landing and did the bull dance.

987
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:06,519
I saw it.

988
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:09,119
Thank you so much for taking
me on this trip, Mom.

989
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:11,163
This is the best day of my life!

990
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:15,679
Okay. Great! Oh, good!
Oh, good. I love you so much.

991
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:19,079
- I'm so glad you're having fun.
- Aw.

992
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:20,406
You're welcome.

993
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:22,119
Thank you so much.

994
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:25,085
- Why you flipping my dad off?
- Huh? I'm not.

995
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:34,039
Yo! Check out white girl
in the neighborhood.

996
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:36,641
Am I right, my brothers? Woo-woo!

997
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,919
I can't believe your
dad's into my mom.

998
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:47,879
He doesn't like her.
She's into him.

999
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:52,519
No way. He's goofy and flabby all over.
My mom's gorgeous with a rocking body.

1000
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:54,399
Hey, that's sick, man.

1001
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,329
That was out of context!

1002
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:58,079
Was it?

1003
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:29,799
You know, you should just go talk to
him because he probably won't bite.

1004
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:32,844
Oh! No, no. I can't.

1005
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:35,119
Got a boyfriend back at home?

1006
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:38,679
Please. All the guys at my school
pretty much assume I'm a lesbian.

1007
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:40,644
And not the hot kind.

1008
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:45,008
Well, have you ever
considered, say, like...

1009
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:46,719
changing your hairstyle?

1010
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:50,119
Our barber only really knows
how to do this and crew cuts.

1011
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:51,679
- So...
- A barber?

1012
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:53,999
Like the kind with a pole outside?

1013
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,319
He cut our grandfather's hair.
He cuts my dad's hair.

1014
00:56:57,320 --> 00:57:00,729
- And now he cuts our hair. Heh.
- May I just...?

1015
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:04,201
Yup.

1016
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:10,519
You have such a beautiful face.

1017
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:18,168
You know, it's funny because I was
actually on my way to the salon.

1018
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:20,329
Do you wanna come
check it out with me?

1019
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:22,359
For what?

1020
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:24,244
For a hairdo...

1021
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:25,799
for a girl...

1022
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:27,570
in this century.

1023
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:32,199
I would but I'd have to
ask my dad for the money.

1024
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:34,971
No. No, no, no. It's on me.

1025
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:37,487
Really?

1026
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:39,839
It would make me so happy.

1027
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:42,247
Because I don't get to
do this with my boys.

1028
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:44,879
- Come on, Prince Valiant.
- Heh.

1029
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:47,759
- I don't know who that is but okay.
- Okay.

1030
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:52,399
Where do you buy your clothes?

1031
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:54,999
Oh, Dad gets most of
our clothes from work.

1032
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,759
Oh, then I guess we should be
grateful he doesn't work at Hooters.

1033
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:01,088
No, my mom worked at Hooters.

1034
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:03,039
She what?

1035
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:07,723
Oh, my mom, she used to work at Hooters.
She managed the one over on Lake Street.

1036
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:11,849
Oh. Heh.

1037
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:22,359
So then he gets down on
one knee and proposes.

1038
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:25,719
Right in the middle
of kickboxing class.

1039
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:28,719
He's lucky he didn't get
kicked in the nuts.

1040
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:30,604
Oh, my nuts! Ha-ha-ha.

1041
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:37,559
Espn. This is the best passion
fruit I've ever tasted. Try it.

1042
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:39,762
And I got some for your mom too.

1043
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:43,159
Thank you.

1044
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:44,719
You're welcome.

1045
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:46,319
So how'd you two sexicans meet?

1046
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:48,959
Yeah! Hitting them with the
hard questions. I like it.

1047
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:51,039
Well, we met on a blind date.

1048
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:54,079
- Argh. Those are the worst.
- Oh.

1049
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:56,359
I've been on 10 blind
dates in my life.

1050
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:59,719
All fatties. Ten for ten.
All fatties.

1051
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:02,886
No offense, Jim.

1052
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:05,039
What?

1053
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:06,810
So what happened?
Where'd he take you?

1054
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:09,359
Actually, Hooters.

1055
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:10,599
Here we go.

1056
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:16,204
Which was wonderful service,
nice people, really great.

1057
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:20,079
Aw. How romantic.

1058
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:23,519
- Oh.
- Aw, everyone's shimmying now.

1059
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:25,719
Shimmy, shimmy, shimmy. Ha-ha-ha.

1060
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:28,730
Why you no shimmy, Jimmy? Shimmy.

1061
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:30,287
Jim?

1062
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:12,761
Where's Larry? What
happened to Larry?

1063
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:14,365
I'm right here, Dad.

1064
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:17,999
Why were the, uh...?

1065
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,202
How did this, uh...?

1066
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:22,369
What's happening right now?

1067
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:25,759
Um, well, Lauren gave me
her salon appointment...

1068
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:26,999
Uh-huh.

1069
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,726
and they put in hair
extensions and makeup...

1070
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:34,999
and she even told them how to style
it and what to do, what not to do.

1071
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,168
She was pretty amazing.

1072
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,968
She was amazing, huh?

1073
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,039
Do you want to go get
some sushi from the bar?

1074
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:45,799
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy, scarecrow!
She's gotta bulk up!

1075
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:49,163
Pork chops! Lamb chops! Tri-tip!

1076
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:51,359
Uh...

1077
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:53,369
Let's go get our beef on?

1078
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:02,159
Uh-oh. I think someone new came to
dinner. A flying baby named Cupid.

1079
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:03,999
- Heh-heh-heh.
- Ping.

1080
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,039
Aah! You got me!

1081
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:12,719
Now we're both in love.

1082
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:17,480
What's the matter?

1083
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:19,479
What's the matter?

1084
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:23,239
I just looked at my daughter,
and I didn't really recognize her.

1085
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:25,090
Kind of threw me off for a minute.

1086
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:29,479
Well, she's 15, you know? She's
bound to grow up at some point.

1087
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:31,079
I know. Call me crazy.

1088
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:35,001
I just thought maybe that would be
my decision because she's my kid!

1089
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:39,079
Okay! Awkward moment.
Uncomfortable. Tension.

1090
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:40,999
I'm leaving the table.
Who's with me?

1091
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,248
- Me! Me!
- I'm going.

1092
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:45,610
Wow.

1093
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:47,159
Whoa. I just...

1094
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:48,559
Can I ask you?

1095
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:52,970
What made you think you could tart up
my daughter without my permission?

1096
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:57,283
You're right. I'm sorry. I am.

1097
01:01:57,560 --> 01:02:01,039
I just find it hypocritical from
someone who nearly killed my son.

1098
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:02,879
So it was getting even? Is that it?

1099
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:05,559
No, it's not getting
even but I just...

1100
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:07,519
- She's beautiful.
- Right.

1101
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:10,279
With that pageboy Prince Valiant
haircut you gave her...

1102
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:12,399
She looked very nice
with that haircut.

1103
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:17,439
and the tracksuit, are you kidding me?
Dying on the inside to come out!

1104
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:22,168
Her mother was tomboyish at her
age and that was fine with me.

1105
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:25,161
You knew your wife when she was 15?

1106
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:28,119
I knew my wife when I was 13.
I had a crush on her.

1107
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:30,448
I have no idea why
she liked me back.

1108
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:33,810
I was 90 percent goofy
and 10 percent loser.

1109
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:39,919
Well, I was 60 percent Urkel
and 40 percent Screech.

1110
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:44,199
Put it to you this way: If I didn't have braces,
my teeth would be hitting you right now.

1111
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:55,879
I'm sorry I yelled at you. I feel like a jerk
because I put your kid on a gooney bird...

1112
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:59,971
- and I didn't ask your permission.
- No, but listen. You're right.

1113
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:04,799
I need to let go of the
reins a little bit.

1114
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:08,721
I just want to say on
behalf of Thathoo...

1115
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:13,919
how happy we are to see you
two lovebirds finally...

1116
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:15,319
blending.

1117
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:18,839
No, we're not blending. We were
just having a conversation.

1118
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:21,679
- Just happy we haven't killed each other yet.
- Heh.

1119
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:23,839
<i>Yes, yes, you are blending</i>

1120
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:25,759
We don't feel that way
about each other!

1121
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:28,079
<i>Yes, you'll be touching</i>

1122
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:30,079
<i>Like wine and bobotie</i>

1123
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:32,199
All right, let's go
and get our beef on!

1124
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:34,199
<i>And like malva pudding</i>

1125
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:35,639
All right, thank you.

1126
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:38,559
I think they're blending over there!
Come now! Come now!

1127
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:40,569
They're blending over here! Yes!

1128
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:52,639
Daddy, look!

1129
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:20,091
Ha-ha-ha. Woo-hoo!

1130
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:27,726
What? I thought I saw an eagle.

1131
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:31,767
I saw a camel! Ha-ha-ha.

1132
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:37,919
Hey, Hilary. Uh... You
wanna come in our truck?

1133
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:40,600
Shouldn't you be in your coffin?
The sun's out right now.

1134
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:42,729
Take a walk, homes.

1135
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:47,451
Eh, yo, yo, yo.

1136
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:49,040
Go ahead.

1137
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:04,719
Oh!

1138
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:06,604
- Oh, my God.
- Ha-ha-ha.

1139
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:14,839
Look, children.

1140
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:17,122
The bush pig has
lost its parents...

1141
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:20,489
so it is being cared for
by Mama and Papa Lion.

1142
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:24,079
Even in nature there
are blended families.

1143
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:25,639
- That's nice.
- That's sweet.

1144
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:37,359
I may have misread that situation.

1145
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:40,239
- You think so, buddy?
- What is wrong with you?

1146
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:00,399
Yeah, Lauren!

1147
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:01,965
Yeah, baby!

1148
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:04,846
- No!
- You can do it, Mom!

1149
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:07,648
Go Lauren! Go Lauren!

1150
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:09,929
Whoa.

1151
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,406
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

1152
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:46,719
Emotional. Time passing. Changes.

1153
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:49,319
It's... it's... It's hard.

1154
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:53,605
You gotta let it go. Turning
the page. Moving on.

1155
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,079
She was a little kid just a...

1156
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:58,239
Processing it. Accepting it.

1157
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:00,599
The circle of life.
Painful, though.

1158
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:02,211
It hurts, right?

1159
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:04,399
No. Not for me. I got a boy.

1160
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:06,250
But you're in the shithouse.

1161
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:07,880
Thanks.

1162
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:10,479
Whoo! Aah!

1163
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:13,759
The view is splendid!

1164
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:17,368
Which mean "who's next?"

1165
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:18,719
Please, Mom?

1166
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:21,239
What? That? Are you crazy? No.

1167
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:24,279
If Mfana can do it, I could
do it. It's totally safe.

1168
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:28,371
There is no way I'm going
to let you do that.

1169
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:32,879
Unless I try it first...

1170
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:35,599
- and make sure you can handle it.
- Yes!

1171
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:37,719
Yeah! Oh, yeah!

1172
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:39,888
Your mom is gonna do it.

1173
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:45,159
You have nothing to worry
about. You are in tight.

1174
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:47,159
You got 50-gauge webbing here.

1175
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:49,959
Possibly malaria is the only
thing you gotta think about.

1176
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:51,919
Don't swallow anything
weird up there.

1177
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:54,679
Okay. What happens if, like,
I wanna signal for help...

1178
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:57,959
- or, like, if I decide to change my mind? Aah!
- Whoa!

1179
01:07:57,960 --> 01:07:59,279
Oh, yeah, baby!

1180
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:00,718
- You look good!
- Oh, my God!

1181
01:08:00,719 --> 01:08:03,079
I change my mind! I change my mind!

1182
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:05,199
- Whoo!
- That's awesome!

1183
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:08,999
Oh.

1184
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:12,521
Wow!

1185
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:16,611
Oh, my God!

1186
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:18,879
It's beautiful!

1187
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:21,319
Go, Mama, go!

1188
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:22,519
Aah! Aah!

1189
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:24,239
There are giraffes!

1190
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:28,119
Jim, there are giraffes right
there! I can see them!

1191
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:30,519
Well, say hello for me!

1192
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,479
Oh, wow!

1193
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:37,841
Oh, this is so pretty!

1194
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:42,919
Oh, my God! Elephants! Elephants!

1195
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:44,519
Aah!

1196
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:50,599
- Thatta girl!
- Go Lauren!

1197
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:54,599
Why is she screaming?

1198
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:58,599
She's not screaming. She's howling.
She's having fun.

1199
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:04,879
Looking good up there, baby!

1200
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:09,319
Fly, Mrs. Thorpopolis!
Fly like the wind!

1201
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:14,724
Tyler! You've gotta try this!

1202
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:20,251
Why you slowing down?

1203
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:23,724
- We're out of gas.
- You're out of gas? What does that mean?

1204
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:26,919
We used to have gas.
But now we're out.

1205
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:28,359
Oh.

1206
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:31,764
Oh, my God! What's happening?

1207
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:34,327
Jim!

1208
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:37,439
- We're out of gas!
- What?

1209
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:40,079
- Oh, no.
- Oh, my God! No!

1210
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:41,479
This is all your fault!

1211
01:09:41,480 --> 01:09:43,799
Don't worry! My dad's gonna
come up with a plan!

1212
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:46,970
- What's the plan?
- Look for a gas station.

1213
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:48,399
You suck.

1214
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:50,959
Why did I let you
talk me into this?

1215
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:52,199
Listen to me!

1216
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:54,119
When you get close to the ground...

1217
01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:56,799
start running fast!

1218
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:59,399
I have the legs of a corgi dog!

1219
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:03,321
It doesn't matter right now!
Move those little babies!

1220
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:06,719
You cannot let your kids
see you die like this!

1221
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:11,639
Go! Go! Go!

1222
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:14,279
Now! Get those legs going!

1223
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:18,879
Oh, my God! Rhino!

1224
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:20,599
- Rhino, rhino!
- Oh, my God!

1225
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:23,559
Spread them!

1226
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:25,799
- Oh, my God!
- Spread the legs!

1227
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:28,599
- Aah!
- Her bagina!

1228
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:30,450
Aah! Cw!

1229
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:34,606
Yeah!

1230
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,479
Ugh!

1231
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:40,959
- Go, go, go, go, go!
- Dad!

1232
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:07,445
Ooh.

1233
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:13,088
Aah.

1234
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:16,679
I didn't have you pegged for
the massage type of guy.

1235
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:19,519
It's the first massage I'll
ever do in my life. I have to.

1236
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:22,279
To see if they can rub my
pancreas out of my neck.

1237
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:25,051
My God. You're welcome, by the way.

1238
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:27,250
For what?

1239
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:29,439
"For what?" For saving you.

1240
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:31,279
You didn't save me.

1241
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:33,119
You told me to keep running.

1242
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:34,879
Why didn't you catch me?

1243
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:37,399
I was supposed to catch you?
Who am I, Batman?

1244
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:39,479
Coming at me like
700 miles an hour.

1245
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:43,559
You're weighing about a buck fifty.
The inertia would rip my arms off my body.

1246
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:47,959
Yes. That's me. I weigh a buck fifty.
If I'm holding your left ass cheek.

1247
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:52,559
- I don't know what women weigh.
- You don't know anything.

1248
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:55,479
- Mm-hm. We'll see.
- Have a nice massage.

1249
01:11:55,480 --> 01:11:58,039
All right. Now do the
same on your partner...

1250
01:11:58,040 --> 01:12:02,679
while making sure to continue to
look deeply into each others' eyes.

1251
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:09,799
- What is this?
- A scene out of The Doors?

1252
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:12,079
I don't know. Uh...

1253
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:14,679
Ma'am? Yeah. I booked a massage.

1254
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:18,566
Yes. You've booked for the
Art of Couples massage.

1255
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:23,439
- I just got a call from my babysitter...
- Oh. There was an avalanche in my back yard...

1256
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:26,319
Come on! This is exactly
what you guys need.

1257
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:28,799
We'll form a massage train.
I'll be the caboose.

1258
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:32,243
- Unacceptable.
- I'm joking.

1259
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:35,999
- Join us.
- No, ma'am.

1260
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,039
- I'm so good.
- I'm being totally honest...

1261
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:39,839
I think you should. This way.

1262
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:42,679
- And there you go.
- Oh, my God.

1263
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:47,199
Okay!

1264
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:51,610
Let's loosen things up by
stroking your lover's neck.

1265
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:54,329
- Okay
- Come on now.

1266
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:56,279
Don't be bashful.

1267
01:12:56,280 --> 01:13:01,486
Give yourself over to the pleasure
of your loving partner's touch.

1268
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:06,885
Yeah.

1269
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:11,205
- Hello.
- How are you?

1270
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:16,399
Ow.

1271
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:18,239
Remember to keep the touch soft.

1272
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:21,046
Lightly brush your fingers
against her skin.

1273
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:23,807
It's so...

1274
01:13:24,280 --> 01:13:25,799
Oh, God! What's happening?

1275
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:27,439
- Is there a bug on me?
- No.

1276
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:32,119
There's no bug. I was just trying
to get some skin, like she said.

1277
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:34,719
- Well, that hurts the jugular.
- I won't do it.

1278
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:37,571
I'm sorry. I don't know...

1279
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:40,322
how to give you a...

1280
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:49,650
Okay, so...

1281
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:51,685
- There you go.
- Oh.

1282
01:13:52,520 --> 01:13:55,679
- That's actually really nice. Heh.
- Good.

1283
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:57,245
Oh, God.

1284
01:13:57,720 --> 01:13:58,919
Oh.

1285
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:01,168
I feel like I'm relaxing.

1286
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:04,079
Oh, it's wonderful.

1287
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:06,959
Excuse me. Am I gonna get some
sort of rub action here...

1288
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:09,279
or does the guy do all
the work in Africa?

1289
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:10,970
Very funny, Mr. Moptopolis.

1290
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:15,641
But he's right. Ladies, it's
time for you to join in.

1291
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:20,399
As your partner moves down to
your shoulders, reach out...

1292
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:22,125
and touch his ears.

1293
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:26,479
Gently rub the lobes between
your thumb and index finger...

1294
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:29,239
as if you were rubbing
the morning dew...

1295
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:32,199
- off a flower petal.
- Uh-huh.

1296
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:34,439
- Are these your flower petals?
- Yes.

1297
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:37,166
- Now rub the dew. Ha, ha. Do the dew.
- Heh.

1298
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:41,679
I'd be doing you a really big favor if I
just yanked these goofy things right off.

1299
01:14:41,680 --> 01:14:44,645
Oh, just shut up,
schlumpy shoulders.

1300
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:48,239
- I do have schlumpy shoulders.
- No, you don't. They're very nice.

1301
01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:51,679
But you know what helps if you
need to work on your posture?

1302
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:54,959
Here, just lift your arms a little bit.
Watch, I'll show you. Right...

1303
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:00,411
Feels very good.

1304
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:03,159
- You have nice shoulders.
- Really?

1305
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:05,799
You really have a lot of muscle.

1306
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:07,239
- Not as much as you.
- Heh.

1307
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:10,039
From carrying that kid around
and smashing his head.

1308
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:13,399
- Ugh.
- Oh, yeah!

1309
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:16,080
Mr. Wernick. Those are not
your wife's shoulders.

1310
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:18,165
Busted!

1311
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:21,884
Loving it though. Respect
the vision. I get it.

1312
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:23,850
- Gotta go for it, right?
- You do!

1313
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:30,448
Whoa.

1314
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:34,439
Mm. That was so relaxing.

1315
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:38,719
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1316
01:15:38,720 --> 01:15:42,720
I hope I put your pancreas
back where it belongs.

1317
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:44,959
I don't even know where
it is right now.

1318
01:15:46,240 --> 01:15:49,919
- Are you my sexy little wormhole?
- Yeah, I'm your sexy little wormhole!

1319
01:15:56,440 --> 01:15:58,130
They have fun.

1320
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:06,279
That's very pretty.

1321
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:13,799
You were very nice. Thank you.

1322
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:15,843
Heh. Oh, you know.

1323
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:19,489
You're a strong woman.
Strong hands.

1324
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:23,004
Mm. I'm glad you like my hands.

1325
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,599
Daddy?

1326
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:30,882
Can Lauren put me to bed?

1327
01:16:31,080 --> 01:16:34,682
Sweetheart, Daddy will put
you to bed in one second.

1328
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:36,919
But I want Lauren.

1329
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:40,602
Lauren... Another time,
Lauren will do that.

1330
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:43,639
But I want her to put
me to bed tonight.

1331
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:45,251
And Daddy said no.

1332
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:47,279
- Mm!
- No.

1333
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:51,079
- Mm!
- No!

1334
01:16:51,080 --> 01:16:53,931
I want Lauren.

1335
01:16:55,480 --> 01:16:57,728
I'm flattered.

1336
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:03,331
That's good. You're all right.

1337
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:07,809
Okay. How's that?
Are you all cozy now?

1338
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:09,639
Yes.

1339
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:13,322
Daddy? Can you give
us some alone time?

1340
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:20,166
I could go to the bathroom outside.
Is that what you want? You got it.

1341
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:22,284
Thrown out of my own tent.

1342
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:24,690
I own him.

1343
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:26,730
It seems that way.

1344
01:17:27,240 --> 01:17:29,920
Can you rub my head so
I have good dreams?

1345
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:33,530
Of course.

1346
01:17:36,040 --> 01:17:38,004
What a cute little head.

1347
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:42,763
Ew.

1348
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:46,164
Couldn't go a little
further from the tent?

1349
01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:50,486
What do you want from me? There could
be gorillas out here, ready to kill.

1350
01:17:57,320 --> 01:18:01,639
Well, why don't you get them to
give you some Flomax or something.

1351
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:04,286
Yep, getting older.
I'll give you that.

1352
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:07,043
Can you sing to me?

1353
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:09,249
Um, sure.

1354
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:12,249
What should I sing?

1355
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:21,085
<i>Somewhere over the rainbow</i>

1356
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:25,281
<i>Way up high</i>

1357
01:18:25,720 --> 01:18:30,482
<i>There's a land that I heard of</i>

1358
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:35,841
<i>Once in a lullaby</i>

1359
01:18:36,040 --> 01:18:39,959
<i>Someday I'll wish upon a star</i>

1360
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:46,327
<i>And wake up where the clouds
Are far behind me</i>

1361
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:51,239
<i>Where troubles melt
like lemon drops</i>

1362
01:18:51,240 --> 01:18:56,924
<i>Away above the chimney tops</i>

1363
01:18:57,160 --> 01:18:59,479
<i>That's where</i>

1364
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:06,609
<i>You'll find me</i>

1365
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:36,759
- There's a gorilla right there!
- Aah!

1366
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:38,319
I'm just kidding! I'm sorry!

1367
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:42,359
I'm sorry, I just couldn't handle how
emotional it was getting. I just... I'm sorry.

1368
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:45,450
Get some rest. I didn't
mean to do that to you.

1369
01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:56,319
So get in your stance.
That's right.

1370
01:19:56,320 --> 01:19:58,959
And spread your legs just
a little bit. Like an inch.

1371
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:01,199
Elbow up. It's all about balance.

1372
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:03,846
That's right. That's right.
Keep your weight right there.

1373
01:20:04,120 --> 01:20:05,879
How do you even play cricket?

1374
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:08,039
We're not playing cricket.
We're playing baseball.

1375
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:11,519
The only thing at the hotel they had
was this stupid battle thingamajiggy.

1376
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:12,719
Who's that guy?

1377
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:15,959
He's some guy named Dale.
Uh, he'll be pitching to you.

1378
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:18,079
Yeah, in cricket we
don't pitch, we bowl.

1379
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:20,279
Hey, Dale. How much
am I paying you?

1380
01:20:20,280 --> 01:20:22,960
Five Brooklyn T-shirts from
your sporting goods store.

1381
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,521
Okay, I'm gonna make it four
if you correct me again.

1382
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:28,561
All right, Dale. Pitch...
Or bowl one in.

1383
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:33,679
- I stink at this.
- No, it's not you. It's not you.

1384
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:36,759
Dale, you think maybe you can
reach the plate? That would help.

1385
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:39,167
Actually, in cricket
we bounce the...

1386
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:41,319
I'll try. I'll try.

1387
01:20:41,320 --> 01:20:44,171
All right. Elbow up.
Come on. Get there.

1388
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:48,319
I don't wanna do this!

1389
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:49,679
Hey. What are you doing?

1390
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:52,559
You don't throw your bat.
Or whatever this thing is called.

1391
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:54,319
- A bat.
- Thank you.

1392
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:58,286
You're an athlete. You're a sportsman.
You gotta respect your equipment.

1393
01:20:58,640 --> 01:21:00,479
- Yes, sir.
- We ain't leaving here...

1394
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:03,650
till you hit the ball as
good as you ride an ostrich.

1395
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:05,851
Pick up the bat.

1396
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:10,079
Hey. I know you're
up there all alone.

1397
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:12,719
It's scary. You feel like all
the pressure's on you.

1398
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:15,924
But guess what?
The pressure is on him.

1399
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:19,481
Doesn't look like he's
feeling the pressure.

1400
01:21:22,160 --> 01:21:26,199
Oh, he's feeling it all right. He doesn't
think he can get the ball past you.

1401
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:31,042
I want you to look him right in the
eyes and let him know you own him.

1402
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:35,279
Go ahead. That's it, big time.

1403
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:36,686
Give him the stink eye.

1404
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:41,399
What's his problem?

1405
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:43,599
Well, look at that.
You rattled him.

1406
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:46,804
Okay. Dale, pitch it
in if ya got the guts.

1407
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:51,359
Whoa!

1408
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:54,439
Yes! Did you see that? I killed it!

1409
01:21:54,440 --> 01:21:56,199
Let's do it a hundred more times.

1410
01:21:56,200 --> 01:21:59,239
If I hit like that, my dad's
gonna start coming to my games.

1411
01:21:59,240 --> 01:22:00,679
What's going on here?

1412
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:03,486
Jim just taught me how to
make the pitcher my bitch.

1413
01:22:03,640 --> 01:22:05,046
Ah-ah-ah.

1414
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:09,279
My brother doesn't need you
to teach him how to hit!

1415
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:11,448
Okay. You wanna show
him how to do it?

1416
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:13,079
Let's see what you got.

1417
01:22:13,080 --> 01:22:15,442
I don't need to prove
anything to you, d-bag.

1418
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:18,846
Dale, did he really
just call me a d-bag?

1419
01:22:18,920 --> 01:22:20,963
This shit just got real.

1420
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:23,759
I'm gonna kill you.

1421
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:26,930
Okay, we'll see. Let's get your
gloves up. Face protected.

1422
01:22:27,080 --> 01:22:28,519
Kick his ass, Brendan!

1423
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:30,679
- What's that?
- Kick his ass, Jim!

1424
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:33,319
Uh-huh. Whoa! Whoa, whoa.

1425
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:35,359
You see, you gotta
look at your target.

1426
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:39,645
How about I put a picture of your babysitter
on my face? Will you look at it then? Huh?

1427
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:42,359
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Just leave her out of this!

1428
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:44,759
Use your right hand.
You're better with that one.

1429
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:47,361
- All right, all right. Boom.
- Oh!

1430
01:22:48,280 --> 01:22:50,719
- You seem pissed at me.
- You just hit me!

1431
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:53,799
No! Before that. Before that,
like when we first met.

1432
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:57,919
- Just think that my mom could do better.
- First of all, she can't do better.

1433
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:00,559
Because no one's better than me.
I am the greatest.

1434
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:03,839
Secondly, I think it's nice that
you wanna protect your mommy.

1435
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:05,279
I hate you!

1436
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:08,370
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Calm down.
Calm down. That was good though.

1437
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:11,399
Showing a little something in there.
Listen, being a man...

1438
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:14,799
ain't about pissing and moaning
anytime something's bothering you.

1439
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:18,243
It's about dealing with what's in
front of you. So deal with me.

1440
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:21,601
Are you okay?

1441
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:25,321
That was sneaky. But I'm fine.

1442
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:28,561
Does that make me a man now, Jimbo?

1443
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:30,679
No.

1444
01:23:30,680 --> 01:23:33,565
Asking me if I was okay,
that was a start.

1445
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:36,889
<i>They are blending</i>

1446
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:40,809
<i>They are bonding</i>

1447
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:46,291
Yeah, that's great. Didn't know you guys
worked out together, but it makes sense.

1448
01:23:46,640 --> 01:23:48,604
<i>When one person</i>

1449
01:23:48,760 --> 01:23:50,679
<i>Meets another</i>

1450
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:53,121
<i>Come together</i>

1451
01:23:53,480 --> 01:23:56,399
<i>Oh, they are blending</i>

1452
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:05,879
And then what happened?

1453
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:11,199
The bowler threw it, and I
hit it like a mile away.

1454
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:14,199
Yeah. And then Jim
taught me how to box.

1455
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:17,599
And after 5 minutes,
I basically knocked him out.

1456
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:18,799
Yeah!

1457
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:20,809
Well, that was nice of him.

1458
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:25,079
Kind of worked out well,
they came on this trip.

1459
01:24:25,080 --> 01:24:28,011
Yes, it did.

1460
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:47,719
<i>Lauren, you looked so hot in this
dress, I had to buy it for you.</i>

1461
01:24:47,720 --> 01:24:49,719
<i>And by "buy," I mean "steal."</i>

1462
01:24:49,720 --> 01:24:51,729
<i>Hope you're having
fun on my vacation.</i>

1463
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:04,479
So its tongue was ridiculous.
It got me, like, all over.

1464
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:06,719
It was, like, in balls.
They were like:

1465
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:10,129
Like a stem going against
each other, head-to-head.

1466
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,799
Dad. Did you comb your hair?

1467
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:17,239
No. Got out of the shower
like this, I guess.

1468
01:25:17,240 --> 01:25:18,851
You took a shower?

1469
01:25:18,920 --> 01:25:22,239
I shower! I'm allowed
to shower. My God.

1470
01:25:22,240 --> 01:25:25,919
- I haven't taken a shower since we got here.
- I know. You stink. I love it.

1471
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:27,399
Yeah, I stink bad.

1472
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:30,843
Yeah, you stink real bad.
Your breath smells terrible.

1473
01:25:34,240 --> 01:25:35,726
Where's Lauren?

1474
01:26:12,120 --> 01:26:13,319
Wow.

1475
01:26:13,320 --> 01:26:15,839
- Look at Mom.
- Hello.

1476
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:17,405
Dad! Say something to her.

1477
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,879
Yes, yes. You look very, very nice.

1478
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:23,526
Oh, well, thank you. You showered.

1479
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:27,599
Am I really known as the non-shower
guy? I shower all the time, guys.

1480
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:28,759
<i>No, he doesn't.</i>

1481
01:26:29,960 --> 01:26:32,639
Ladies and gentlemen...

1482
01:26:32,640 --> 01:26:34,679
it's the final night...

1483
01:26:34,680 --> 01:26:39,359
of our blended family
experience here in Africa.

1484
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:46,639
Our tradition is to invite the
kiddies to the pool area...

1485
01:26:46,640 --> 01:26:50,159
for our famous kids-only
safari buffet...

1486
01:26:50,160 --> 01:26:53,919
and 10-foot chocolate
rain forest fountain!

1487
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:55,359
Can we go, Dad?

1488
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:57,879
All right, go ahead.
Stay with you sisters though.

1489
01:26:57,880 --> 01:27:00,639
My boy here's a chocoholic.
You better watch out.

1490
01:27:00,640 --> 01:27:04,599
Or he's gonna jump in and come out
looking like a handsome Hershey bar.

1491
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:08,730
Did you see that?

1492
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:12,488
I made him smile. He tried not
to but he couldn't help himself.

1493
01:27:13,160 --> 01:27:16,489
- We're gonna be a great family.
- Yes, we are.

1494
01:27:18,040 --> 01:27:19,599
Love you.

1495
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:23,486
All of the little ones have gone.

1496
01:27:23,560 --> 01:27:26,331
Tonight the dining room is:

1497
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:29,242
Adults-only.

1498
01:27:29,480 --> 01:27:31,959
Yeah, now we're getting there.

1499
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:35,319
Let's have all you blended
lovers on the dance floor.

1500
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:49,359
<i>Love</i>

1501
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:53,963
<i>Is a many blended thing</i>

1502
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:58,724
<i>It's the April rose</i>

1503
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:00,759
<i>That only grows
In the early spring</i>

1504
01:28:00,760 --> 01:28:02,079
It's crazy, huh?

1505
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:03,399
The song.

1506
01:28:03,400 --> 01:28:07,039
He took the word "splendid"
and replaced it with "blended."

1507
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:09,639
So clever. It rhymes!

1508
01:28:09,640 --> 01:28:12,399
But, the real word is "splendored."

1509
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:14,329
So wouldn't it be "blendored"?

1510
01:28:14,680 --> 01:28:15,999
What's this now?

1511
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:17,999
I'm just rambling.
I'm sorry. What...?

1512
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,719
- Heh.
- Are you ready, Mr. Chiapetolis?

1513
01:28:20,720 --> 01:28:23,400
"Chiapetolis"? All right.
He finally got it.

1514
01:28:23,401 --> 01:28:28,559
- Heh. Ready for what?
- You scheduled a star-gazing experience.

1515
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:29,886
So...

1516
01:28:30,040 --> 01:28:33,164
Mrs. Chiapetolis, would
you like to come join me?

1517
01:28:33,400 --> 01:28:35,639
- Oh. Yeah.
- All right.

1518
01:28:38,160 --> 01:28:41,639
<i>Once</i>

1519
01:28:41,640 --> 01:28:45,287
<i>High on a windy hill</i>

1520
01:28:45,640 --> 01:28:48,439
<i>Or two hills, that's good</i>

1521
01:28:48,440 --> 01:28:52,884
<i>On a morning mist,
Two lovers kiss</i>

1522
01:28:53,240 --> 01:28:55,159
Just a little bit farther.

1523
01:28:55,160 --> 01:28:57,119
- All right. Thank you.
- Okay.

1524
01:28:59,240 --> 01:29:01,044
Here we are.

1525
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:03,004
Dinner for two.

1526
01:29:03,160 --> 01:29:04,439
Oh, yeah.

1527
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:05,719
Wow.

1528
01:29:05,720 --> 01:29:06,999
This is good.

1529
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:12,279
I gotta give it up to Dick. He's probably
the most romantic guy on the planet.

1530
01:29:12,280 --> 01:29:15,211
Yeah, he's got the moves.
No doubt about it.

1531
01:29:15,240 --> 01:29:18,399
I bet this is where he was
gonna ask Jen to marry him.

1532
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:19,599
Maybe.

1533
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:22,799
We were able to get everything
you asked for this morning...

1534
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:26,679
except the sticks of cheese
in the shape of a heart.

1535
01:29:26,680 --> 01:29:28,370
Cheese sticks?

1536
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:31,559
Did you set this up?

1537
01:29:31,560 --> 01:29:33,205
I wanted a do-over.

1538
01:29:33,400 --> 01:29:35,204
For that first date fiasco.

1539
01:29:35,480 --> 01:29:36,966
I'm better than that.

1540
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:44,367
Which means:

1541
01:29:44,640 --> 01:29:49,599
"Lovers long for the moment their
souls may blend in a whisper."

1542
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:52,883
- Mm.
- May this be your moment.

1543
01:29:53,560 --> 01:29:56,879
Did you eat pork chops...

1544
01:29:56,880 --> 01:29:59,279
with tuna fish today at lunch?

1545
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:01,679
- Yes, I did.
- I can tell.

1546
01:30:01,680 --> 01:30:05,965
Apologies. I will brush my teeth
presently, Mr. Lollipopolis.

1547
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:09,239
I'd brush them twice. And did you
really call me "Lollipopolis"?

1548
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,559
It's Theodopolis.
Just for the record.

1549
01:30:13,560 --> 01:30:15,569
I know. I just like to have fun...

1550
01:30:15,720 --> 01:30:17,159
Jim Friedman.

1551
01:30:17,160 --> 01:30:20,045
- Wha...?
- What?

1552
01:30:20,120 --> 01:30:23,599
- That was good.
- Thank you, Mfana.

1553
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:32,599
How about Thathoo
showing up everywhere?

1554
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:36,441
They were in my shower this morning.
I had a very nice time with them too.

1555
01:30:39,160 --> 01:30:41,959
There she is. Oh,
thank you so much.

1556
01:30:41,960 --> 01:30:45,369
Hey, Bubbles. Nice wiggle, but
you grew a tail. Ha-ha-ha.

1557
01:30:45,880 --> 01:30:47,519
Here's looking at you.

1558
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:51,167
No, really. Looking at you, because
you're actually looking at me this time.

1559
01:30:53,560 --> 01:30:55,000
You...

1560
01:30:56,280 --> 01:30:58,801
have the most beautiful...

1561
01:31:01,400 --> 01:31:02,681
kids.

1562
01:31:03,320 --> 01:31:06,046
- Oh. Thank you.
- Sure.

1563
01:31:07,360 --> 01:31:09,483
You're a great mom too.

1564
01:31:10,160 --> 01:31:12,840
You're a pretty good mom yourself.

1565
01:31:13,320 --> 01:31:14,806
I'll take that.

1566
01:31:15,200 --> 01:31:17,639
Tyler has a playoff
game on Saturday...

1567
01:31:17,640 --> 01:31:18,887
Yeah?

1568
01:31:19,080 --> 01:31:22,363
and I think that...

1569
01:31:23,480 --> 01:31:30,199
for the very first time, he won't actually
be completely dreading it, thanks to you.

1570
01:31:30,200 --> 01:31:34,239
Tell your... His father the more he works with
him, the more he's gonna get confident...

1571
01:31:34,240 --> 01:31:36,839
the more he's gonna belt the
ball anytime he gets up there.

1572
01:31:36,840 --> 01:31:41,319
Yeah, well, his dad's not really
into working with him, you know...

1573
01:31:41,320 --> 01:31:46,162
because to do that, he'd have to show
up, which he's just not good at.

1574
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:48,519
You gotta show up for your kids.

1575
01:31:48,520 --> 01:31:52,202
It should be boring how
reliable a parent is.

1576
01:31:52,920 --> 01:31:56,839
It's funny to me that some
people don't get that. You do!

1577
01:31:56,840 --> 01:32:00,919
I mean, your kid needs to come
first 100 percent of the time.

1578
01:32:00,920 --> 01:32:03,088
Absolutely. 99 percent.

1579
01:32:03,120 --> 01:32:07,239
One percent of the time, I think we
are allowed to get what we want.

1580
01:32:07,240 --> 01:32:09,759
Aah. God.

1581
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:13,282
I forgot what it was
like to want something.

1582
01:32:13,720 --> 01:32:18,608
I vaguely remember it feels good.

1583
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:31,919
I can't do this.

1584
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:34,282
I can't do this. I'm sorry.

1585
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:40,323
I really... I'm... It's not you.

1586
01:32:43,720 --> 01:32:45,968
I thought I could
do this. I just...

1587
01:32:51,080 --> 01:32:53,009
Sorry about them too.

1588
01:32:55,480 --> 01:32:57,205
They're still awesome.

1589
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:06,203
Sorry I did that to you.

1590
01:33:08,280 --> 01:33:10,323
<i>He didn't kiss you?</i>

1591
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:13,531
He's an idiot.

1592
01:33:14,080 --> 01:33:17,919
Although, you have to admit. The
monkeys playing the violins and stuff?

1593
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:19,610
That is hilarious.

1594
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:22,439
I can't believe that we both
found these great guys...

1595
01:33:22,440 --> 01:33:24,439
and we're not gonna
end up with them.

1596
01:33:27,440 --> 01:33:29,085
Are you gonna get that?

1597
01:33:33,640 --> 01:33:35,968
Hi. It's not a good time right now.

1598
01:33:38,120 --> 01:33:39,559
I L word you so hard.

1599
01:33:39,560 --> 01:33:42,359
And you know what? I am
gonna make L word to you...

1600
01:33:42,360 --> 01:33:44,079
for at least an hour and a half.

1601
01:33:45,800 --> 01:33:47,081
Okay.

1602
01:33:50,080 --> 01:33:52,039
That was my mom.

1603
01:33:52,040 --> 01:33:53,810
And she's doing good.

1604
01:33:55,320 --> 01:33:57,921
All right. I'm giving
Dick another chance.

1605
01:33:57,960 --> 01:34:00,606
To do what? Get rid of his kids?

1606
01:34:01,680 --> 01:34:04,406
I'm gonna meet his children. Heh.

1607
01:34:05,120 --> 01:34:09,006
You should try saying that without
contorting your face so much.

1608
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:12,287
I'm gonna meet his children.

1609
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:14,762
Heh. Better.

1610
01:34:15,280 --> 01:34:17,005
I'm sorry about Jim.

1611
01:34:17,960 --> 01:34:19,446
Me too.

1612
01:34:44,040 --> 01:34:46,129
Why didn't you kiss her, man?

1613
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:50,691
I couldn't. I just...

1614
01:34:51,640 --> 01:34:55,367
I was afraid it wasn't
the right thing to do.

1615
01:34:56,640 --> 01:34:59,286
What did Africa do to you?

1616
01:35:03,640 --> 01:35:05,808
- That doesn't hurt. Stop.
- Ow.

1617
01:35:06,120 --> 01:35:09,210
I'm trying my best. Just sit still.

1618
01:35:09,320 --> 01:35:11,999
- Does it look pretty?
- It looks fantastic. Yeah.

1619
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:13,850
Yay.

1620
01:35:14,200 --> 01:35:16,289
Ha-ha-ha. No.

1621
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:19,639
- You look nice.
- Oh, thanks.

1622
01:35:19,640 --> 01:35:22,559
- Where you off to?
- Oh, I'm going on a date with Jake.

1623
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:25,439
How can you go out with Jake?
He lives in Vancouver.

1624
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:26,999
<i>Hi, Mr. Friedman.</i>

1625
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:30,839
Yay there, Skeletor. Listen,
make sure plenty of beef.

1626
01:35:30,840 --> 01:35:32,883
Seriously. She's got
tryouts this week.

1627
01:35:33,160 --> 01:35:35,966
<i>Lamb chops, pork chops,
tri-tips. You got it.</i>

1628
01:35:36,040 --> 01:35:37,959
That's the way.

1629
01:35:37,960 --> 01:35:39,679
Garbage twisties?

1630
01:35:39,680 --> 01:35:41,679
- I don't know how to...
- You're awful.

1631
01:35:41,680 --> 01:35:43,199
Just fix it then.

1632
01:35:43,200 --> 01:35:45,402
So when are we gonna
see Lauren again?

1633
01:35:45,640 --> 01:35:47,799
Something happened
between you guys.

1634
01:35:47,800 --> 01:35:50,319
No. What are you, crazy?
Nothing happened.

1635
01:35:50,320 --> 01:35:52,679
Dad, come on. I saw the
way you looked at her.

1636
01:35:52,680 --> 01:35:55,439
- And I saw the way she looked at you.
<i>- It's undeniable.</i>

1637
01:35:55,440 --> 01:35:58,839
<i>- You guys are infatuated with each other.</i>
- Jake, butt out.

1638
01:35:58,840 --> 01:35:59,999
<i>Sorry, sir.</i>

1639
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:03,839
Don't you guys have anything better to do
than look at people looking at each other?

1640
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:06,039
Besides, what am I supposed to do?

1641
01:36:06,040 --> 01:36:09,244
Change our whole lives just
because I'm in love with her?

1642
01:36:11,240 --> 01:36:12,680
Yes!

1643
01:36:15,120 --> 01:36:17,039
Wow.

1644
01:36:17,040 --> 01:36:19,599
<i>Aah! So romantic!</i>

1645
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:23,168
<i>Loving it! Taking a risk.
Go get her, baby!</i>

1646
01:36:27,240 --> 01:36:29,799
I know I confused you.

1647
01:36:29,800 --> 01:36:32,890
I just had to make sure.

1648
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:34,999
For my wife and for my kids.

1649
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,885
And for your kids.
And for you. And...

1650
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,239
Just so we have no lies.

1651
01:36:41,240 --> 01:36:44,279
It was me who drank
your beer at Hooters.

1652
01:36:44,280 --> 01:36:47,359
I don't know why I did that.
I get free beers there...

1653
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:50,040
so it was just panic then.

1654
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:08,881
Yeah?

1655
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:12,282
This is 323, right?

1656
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:13,966
Yeah.

1657
01:37:14,520 --> 01:37:16,449
I was looking for Lauren.

1658
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:18,411
You and me both.

1659
01:37:19,040 --> 01:37:20,287
Jim!

1660
01:37:20,760 --> 01:37:22,928
Big time! Look at you!

1661
01:37:23,160 --> 01:37:25,647
Mom's not home. This is my dad.

1662
01:37:26,240 --> 01:37:27,441
Mark.

1663
01:37:27,640 --> 01:37:29,159
Yeah. Who are you?

1664
01:37:29,160 --> 01:37:31,089
Jim! The cool guy from the safari.

1665
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:34,041
Do you wanna "bowl"
me a few pitches?

1666
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:37,441
I'm sure your father wants
to do that with you.

1667
01:37:38,200 --> 01:37:39,439
No, he doesn't.

1668
01:37:39,440 --> 01:37:42,246
No, no, no, no. Go get
your bat, big time.

1669
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:44,279
Hey! We can all play!

1670
01:37:44,280 --> 01:37:46,482
I'll get Brendan's glove.
He never uses it.

1671
01:37:47,160 --> 01:37:49,919
Boy, he hasn't shut up
about that Africa trip.

1672
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:52,851
Your kids are incredible.

1673
01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:54,119
Yeah.

1674
01:37:54,120 --> 01:37:59,199
That's why Lauren and I are, you know,
trying to make things work again.

1675
01:37:59,200 --> 01:38:00,640
For them.

1676
01:38:01,680 --> 01:38:04,079
- I didn't know that.
- Yeah.

1677
01:38:04,080 --> 01:38:06,039
I'll tell her you came by.

1678
01:38:06,040 --> 01:38:09,403
And I'll put these
in the bedroom...

1679
01:38:09,800 --> 01:38:11,968
next to where we make love.

1680
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:16,571
Okay.

1681
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:21,811
Tell Tyler I said goodbye.

1682
01:38:25,120 --> 01:38:26,685
Where's Jim going?

1683
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:29,289
He had stuff to do, I guess.

1684
01:38:30,280 --> 01:38:32,639
- Can you and me play then?
- Yeah, of co...

1685
01:38:33,880 --> 01:38:36,447
Ooh. Saved by the bell.

1686
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:38,330
Hey, what's up?

1687
01:38:38,680 --> 01:38:40,405
You busy?

1688
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:13,767
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

1689
01:39:13,960 --> 01:39:17,119
Is there a <i>GQ</i> photo
shoot going on here?

1690
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:20,642
Oh, no. I'm just, uh...
I'm just chilling.

1691
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:25,603
I'm sorry that took so long. Thank
you for watching after the boys.

1692
01:39:25,640 --> 01:39:29,399
I'm done now and I'm guessing you
have somewhere you gotta go so...

1693
01:39:29,400 --> 01:39:31,170
How do you always look so great?

1694
01:39:31,680 --> 01:39:35,039
Yeah? It's my haven't-washed-
my-hair-in-three-days look.

1695
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:36,719
Thanks for noticing.

1696
01:39:36,720 --> 01:39:39,161
Heh. You're so funny.

1697
01:39:40,400 --> 01:39:42,919
It's hard for me to imagine
you with someone else.

1698
01:39:42,920 --> 01:39:45,559
Really? It wasn't hard for
you to imagine yourself...

1699
01:39:45,560 --> 01:39:47,719
with someone else when
you cheated on me.

1700
01:39:47,720 --> 01:39:51,319
You always bring it back to that.
I could say, "Hey, look at that house."

1701
01:39:51,320 --> 01:39:54,399
And you'd say, "Oh, we lived in a
house when you cheated on me."

1702
01:39:54,400 --> 01:39:57,239
Or I could say, "Pass that pickle."
And you could say, I don't know.

1703
01:39:57,240 --> 01:39:59,919
Something about a pickle
and you cheating on me.

1704
01:40:02,280 --> 01:40:04,679
It's fun to laugh with
you again, Lauren.

1705
01:40:04,680 --> 01:40:06,530
We used to do that all the time.

1706
01:40:06,720 --> 01:40:08,410
You brought flowers?

1707
01:40:09,640 --> 01:40:10,887
Yeah.

1708
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:15,290
Why'd you bring flowers?

1709
01:40:15,560 --> 01:40:17,728
Because you deserve flowers.

1710
01:40:19,920 --> 01:40:23,681
Lauren, when you went away to
Africa, I did a lot of thinking.

1711
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:28,799
You and I, we have so much
history together. Two boys.

1712
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:30,119
One receptionist.

1713
01:40:30,120 --> 01:40:33,119
Look, I made a mistake!

1714
01:40:33,120 --> 01:40:36,239
You made it at least four
mistakes that I know of.

1715
01:40:36,240 --> 01:40:37,959
Made. Past tense.

1716
01:40:37,960 --> 01:40:40,003
I was a jerk.

1717
01:40:40,080 --> 01:40:42,806
Lauren, you were the
best thing in my life.

1718
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:44,286
You and the boys.

1719
01:40:45,600 --> 01:40:48,804
And boys need their fathers.

1720
01:40:49,320 --> 01:40:50,726
They do.

1721
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,362
I know that I'm a good father.

1722
01:40:53,680 --> 01:40:55,559
I just need to prove it to them.

1723
01:40:55,560 --> 01:40:58,081
Well, you can! It's not too late.

1724
01:40:58,320 --> 01:41:00,279
Is it too late...

1725
01:41:00,280 --> 01:41:01,891
for this?

1726
01:41:03,280 --> 01:41:05,919
What are you doing?

1727
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:07,599
I'm coming home, baby.

1728
01:41:07,600 --> 01:41:10,485
Oh! Mark! Get off of me!

1729
01:41:10,520 --> 01:41:12,449
You don't live here anymore!

1730
01:41:13,480 --> 01:41:14,920
Is there someone else?

1731
01:41:14,921 --> 01:41:19,364
Heh. No. And that's none
of your business anyway.

1732
01:41:20,640 --> 01:41:22,799
You're interested in
being a good father?

1733
01:41:22,800 --> 01:41:25,287
Tyler has a game on
Saturday. Be there.

1734
01:41:46,320 --> 01:41:47,851
Dad?

1735
01:41:48,120 --> 01:41:50,402
I didn't mean to wake you. Sorry.

1736
01:41:51,800 --> 01:41:54,002
I was talking to Mom before bed.

1737
01:41:54,840 --> 01:41:57,759
- Mm-hm.
- And...

1738
01:41:57,760 --> 01:42:01,601
she says she has a
lot of stuff to do.

1739
01:42:02,840 --> 01:42:04,087
She does?

1740
01:42:04,720 --> 01:42:10,211
Yeah. So she might not be
able to hang around as much.

1741
01:42:13,280 --> 01:42:14,925
Okay.

1742
01:42:15,120 --> 01:42:19,245
She also said you need to increase
my allowance to 5 dollars.

1743
01:42:20,040 --> 01:42:22,129
She's very generous.

1744
01:42:26,320 --> 01:42:27,885
I just...

1745
01:42:30,720 --> 01:42:33,287
I don't want her to disappear.

1746
01:42:33,880 --> 01:42:37,959
Sweetheart, she's never
gonna disappear.

1747
01:42:37,960 --> 01:42:39,446
Never ever.

1748
01:42:40,040 --> 01:42:44,359
You can let her go. She
will always be right here.

1749
01:42:44,360 --> 01:42:47,803
And I will always be here.
I promise you.

1750
01:43:00,280 --> 01:43:02,239
By the way...

1751
01:43:02,240 --> 01:43:04,727
Mom loved the Africa trip.

1752
01:43:05,240 --> 01:43:06,885
So did I.

1753
01:43:10,360 --> 01:43:11,686
I miss her.

1754
01:43:12,200 --> 01:43:14,368
Your mother was the greatest.

1755
01:43:15,280 --> 01:43:17,084
I mean Lauren.

1756
01:43:20,480 --> 01:43:21,966
Me too.

1757
01:43:22,680 --> 01:43:25,645
We don't have to let
go of her too, do we?

1758
01:43:26,080 --> 01:43:27,930
Come here.

1759
01:43:39,120 --> 01:43:42,039
Brendan, don't forget that I'm
picking you up for Scouts...

1760
01:43:42,040 --> 01:43:43,685
so don't take the bus home.

1761
01:43:43,880 --> 01:43:46,879
Thanks for telling everyone
I'm still in Scouts, Mom.

1762
01:43:46,880 --> 01:43:49,481
You're a good boy. Be
proud of who you are.

1763
01:43:52,280 --> 01:43:53,925
<i>Love you.</i>

1764
01:44:12,880 --> 01:44:15,048
Say one word and you're dead.

1765
01:44:15,160 --> 01:44:17,522
You're driving a minivan.

1766
01:44:17,640 --> 01:44:19,159
It's Dick's.

1767
01:44:19,160 --> 01:44:22,523
I'm off to buy toilet paper
for Team Theodopolis.

1768
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:26,159
When the team needs toilet paper,
the co-captain goes and gets it.

1769
01:44:26,160 --> 01:44:28,931
And believe me, those
kids never stop crapping.

1770
01:44:29,560 --> 01:44:31,439
Kids need to crap.

1771
01:44:31,440 --> 01:44:34,803
You need anything from Walmart?

1772
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:36,847
I'm good.

1773
01:44:37,640 --> 01:44:40,844
- See you at the PTA meeting.
- Okay, foxy.

1774
01:44:54,920 --> 01:44:57,361
Yeah! Base on!

1775
01:44:57,720 --> 01:45:00,079
This is so good, honey.

1776
01:45:00,080 --> 01:45:03,204
- This is family.
- This is fun for me.

1777
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,639
- Way to go, Dad.
- One out to go.

1778
01:45:10,640 --> 01:45:13,959
But Standard Fence
has a rally going.

1779
01:45:13,960 --> 01:45:19,359
Now batting, number
23, Tyler Reynolds.

1780
01:45:21,520 --> 01:45:24,879
- Hey, that's not nice!
- Shut up. That kid's awful.

1781
01:45:24,880 --> 01:45:27,319
Go Tyler!

1782
01:45:27,320 --> 01:45:28,760
Tracy.

1783
01:45:29,360 --> 01:45:31,369
What's your head doing here?

1784
01:45:51,600 --> 01:45:53,643
Strike one!

1785
01:45:53,840 --> 01:45:55,804
I'm so sorry Mark didn't show up.

1786
01:45:56,040 --> 01:46:00,404
He just doesn't get it, you know? Your kids
have to come first 100 percent of the time.

1787
01:46:00,560 --> 01:46:03,570
Well, like, 99 percent. You
get one percent for yourself.

1788
01:46:04,320 --> 01:46:05,885
- That's great news.
- Heh.

1789
01:46:06,080 --> 01:46:09,489
Well, no matter what, you have
to show up for your kids.

1790
01:46:10,400 --> 01:46:11,879
Like him.

1791
01:46:11,880 --> 01:46:15,359
- Hey, hey! All right, big time!
- Come on, Tyler!

1792
01:46:15,360 --> 01:46:17,244
Looking good out there!

1793
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:20,605
Get that elbow up!

1794
01:46:20,760 --> 01:46:22,166
Elbow up!

1795
01:46:22,320 --> 01:46:24,170
Incredible.

1796
01:46:29,600 --> 01:46:30,961
Come on, Tyler.

1797
01:46:33,240 --> 01:46:34,599
Strike two!

1798
01:46:34,600 --> 01:46:36,086
All right, all right!

1799
01:46:38,480 --> 01:46:41,719
Nice cut, nice cut. Slow
it down a little bit.

1800
01:46:41,720 --> 01:46:44,879
Bend those knees. Balance, okay?

1801
01:46:44,880 --> 01:46:47,479
Take care of this. That's it.

1802
01:46:47,480 --> 01:46:49,603
Elbow up. Higher, higher.

1803
01:46:49,920 --> 01:46:51,879
Now, remember the stink eye.

1804
01:46:55,400 --> 01:46:57,839
The mustache is rattled.

1805
01:46:57,840 --> 01:46:59,319
Come on, Tyler, let's go!

1806
01:46:59,320 --> 01:47:01,010
Take them deep.

1807
01:47:18,920 --> 01:47:20,201
You hit it!

1808
01:47:20,520 --> 01:47:22,279
Run, Tyler, run!

1809
01:47:30,200 --> 01:47:32,641
Keep going, brother! Go!

1810
01:47:33,480 --> 01:47:34,806
Go now!

1811
01:47:35,640 --> 01:47:37,729
Don't hesitate. Come, come!

1812
01:47:39,680 --> 01:47:41,679
Come to me, big time!

1813
01:47:41,680 --> 01:47:44,406
Go! Run to me!

1814
01:47:45,720 --> 01:47:47,479
Keep it going, Tyler!

1815
01:47:47,480 --> 01:47:49,489
We're going home, baby!

1816
01:47:49,720 --> 01:47:51,524
We're going home!

1817
01:47:53,040 --> 01:47:54,399
Safe!

1818
01:47:54,400 --> 01:47:56,409
Yeah! Yes!

1819
01:47:58,520 --> 01:48:01,041
Do you believe in miracles?

1820
01:48:03,960 --> 01:48:05,599
Yeah! Whoo!

1821
01:48:05,600 --> 01:48:09,247
Yeah! That's my brother!

1822
01:48:09,640 --> 01:48:11,604
Ha, ha! Whoo.

1823
01:48:12,080 --> 01:48:13,559
Thank you.

1824
01:48:13,560 --> 01:48:16,127
All you in there, big time.

1825
01:48:16,440 --> 01:48:18,404
Oh, my God!

1826
01:48:21,360 --> 01:48:22,891
What are you doing?

1827
01:48:23,640 --> 01:48:25,285
I love you!

1828
01:48:25,880 --> 01:48:27,879
That was amazing.

1829
01:48:27,880 --> 01:48:31,319
I'm so sorry to show up like this.
I was at your house the other day...

1830
01:48:31,320 --> 01:48:34,879
and I saw your ex-husband blow off
Tyler when he wanted to practice.

1831
01:48:34,880 --> 01:48:38,209
I know you guys are trying to work
it out, but it broke my heart.

1832
01:48:38,720 --> 01:48:41,491
We're not working it out.
That's never gonna happen.

1833
01:48:41,720 --> 01:48:42,967
Really?

1834
01:48:44,520 --> 01:48:46,961
What were you doing at my house?

1835
01:48:47,160 --> 01:48:49,806
I came by to tell you that...

1836
01:48:51,120 --> 01:48:54,164
I think it's okay now.

1837
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:56,639
Okay for what?

1838
01:48:56,640 --> 01:49:00,399
Okay to have one of those
rare, rare moments...

1839
01:49:00,400 --> 01:49:02,329
where we get what we want.

1840
01:49:02,560 --> 01:49:04,759
Oh.

1841
01:49:04,760 --> 01:49:06,644
Well, what do we want?

1842
01:49:07,320 --> 01:49:09,170
You know what we want.

1843
01:49:10,280 --> 01:49:13,848
Yeah. I think the kids want it too.

1844
01:49:14,160 --> 01:49:17,479
Not as much as I do there,
schlumpy shoulders.

1845
01:49:19,360 --> 01:49:21,050
Wait.

1846
01:49:21,640 --> 01:49:23,330
I can't do this.

1847
01:49:24,320 --> 01:49:25,521
You're kidding me.

1848
01:49:25,760 --> 01:49:28,959
Heh. Totally. I just had to
get you back for Africa.

1849
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:30,241
Come on.

1850
01:49:39,960 --> 01:49:41,719
You know something?

1851
01:49:41,720 --> 01:49:43,959
Your mom is hot.

1852
01:49:43,960 --> 01:49:46,083
Your dad's pretty hot too.

1853
01:49:47,040 --> 01:49:48,679
Not hot.

1854
01:49:50,960 --> 01:49:52,559
Come on, you deserve
a nice massage.

1855
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,519
- Ow! Oh, it's good.
- Come on, you like that.

1856
01:49:56,520 --> 01:49:58,961
- Oh, it hurts so good.
- Sorry.

1857
01:50:02,440 --> 01:50:04,319
<i>Look, they're blending</i>

1858
01:50:04,320 --> 01:50:06,199
<i>Hearts are mending</i>

1859
01:50:06,200 --> 01:50:08,479
<i>Sad times ending
Good times spending</i>

1860
01:50:08,480 --> 01:50:09,886
<i>With love</i>

1861
01:50:10,280 --> 01:50:12,479
<i>Kids are friending</i>

1862
01:50:12,480 --> 01:50:13,886
<i>Wedding trending</i>

1863
01:50:14,200 --> 01:50:18,239
<i>Blending, friending, blending, friending
Movie ending</i>

1
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,448
<i>Once upon a time,
there was a girl called Ella.</i>

2
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,647
<i>And she saw the world
not always as it was,</i>

3
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:07,123
<i>but as perhaps it could be,
with just a little bit of magic.</i>

4
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,360
My darling!

5
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,728
<i>To her mother and father,
she was a princess.</i>

6
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,202
<i>True, she had no title,
nor crown, nor castle,</i>

7
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,763
<i>but she was the ruler
of her own little kingdom,</i>

8
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,765
<i>whose borders were the house
and meadow on the forest's edge</i>

9
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,810
<i>where her people
had lived for generations.</i>

10
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,801
<i>With Mr. Goose</i>

11
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,488
<i>and all their animal family.</i>

12
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,250
Hello, there.
What do you think you're doing?

13
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,084
Let the little ones have their share.

14
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,523
We don't want you getting
an upset stomach.

15
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,609
Gus-Gus, you're a house mouse,
not a garden mouse.

16
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,364
Isn't he, Jacqueline?

17
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,125
And you mustn't eat Mr. Goose's food.

18
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,361
Isn't that right, Mummy?

19
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,761
Do you still believe
that they understand you?

20
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,127
- Don't they, Mother?
- Yes.

21
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,640
I believe that animals listen
and speak to us

22
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,370
if we only have the ear for it.

23
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,924
That's how we learn to look after them.

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,206
Who looks after us?

25
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,807
Fairy godmothers, of course.

26
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,450
And do you believe in them?

27
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,931
I believe in everything.

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,241
Then I believe in everything, too.

29
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,929
<i>Her father was a merchant</i>

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,206
<i>who went abroad</i>

31
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,126
<i>and brought tribute back from
all of Ella's subject lands.</i>

32
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,645
Ella!

33
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,569
Where are my girls, my beautiful girls?

34
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,924
Where are my darlings?

35
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,646
<i>Ella missed him terribly
when he was away.</i>

36
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,927
<i>But she knew he would always return.</i>

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,048
- There she is!
- Papa, welcome home!

38
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,167
How are you?

39
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,526
You've grown!

40
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,331
Haven't you, now?

41
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,882
- There you go, sir.
- What was that?

42
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,811
This?

43
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,803
I found it hanging on a tree.

44
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:03,010
I think there may be something inside.

45
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,729
It's so pretty.

46
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,530
In French, that is <i>un papillon.</i>

47
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,571
You're standing on my feet.

48
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,241
Shall we?

49
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,922
Look, Mummy! I'm dancing!

50
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,888
Little <i>papillon.</i>

51
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,521
<i>All was just as it should be.</i>

52
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,400
<i>They knew themselves to be the most
happy of families to live as they did</i>

53
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,448
<i>and to love each other so.</i>

54
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,205
<i>When I am king
dilly, dilly</i>

55
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,806
<i>You shall be queen</i>

56
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,205
<i>Lavender's green
dilly, dilly</i>

57
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,760
<i>Lavender's blue</i>

58
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,851
<i>You must love me
dilly, dilly</i>

59
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,651
<i>For I love you</i>

60
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,567
<i>But sorrow can come to any kingdom,</i>

61
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,768
<i>no matter how happy.</i>

62
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,206
<i>And so it came to Ella's home.</i>

63
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,926
I'm so sorry.

64
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,764
Thank you, Doctor.

65
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,169
This must have been
very difficult for you.

66
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,040
Come.

67
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,526
Ella.

68
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,961
Ella, my darling.

69
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,842
I want to tell you a secret.

70
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,131
A great secret that will see you through

71
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,043
all the trials that life can offer.

72
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,727
You must always remember this.

73
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,051
Have courage and be kind.

74
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,281
You have more kindness
in your little finger

75
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,523
than most people possess
in their whole body.

76
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:39,128
And it has power, more than you know.

77
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,888
- And magic.
- Magic?

78
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,961
Truly.

79
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,202
Have courage and be kind, my darling.

80
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,086
Will you promise me?

81
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,606
I promise.

82
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,401
Good.

83
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,287
Good.

84
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,721
And...

85
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,484
I must go very soon, my love.

86
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,963
Please forgive me.

87
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,762
Of course I forgive you.

88
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,690
I love you.

89
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,569
I love you, my darling.

90
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,605
I love you.

91
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:47,161
<i>Time passed,
and pain turned to memory.</i>

92
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,490
<i>In her heart, Ella stayed the same.</i>

93
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,323
<i>For she remembered
her promise to her mother.</i>

94
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,604
<i>Have courage, and be kind.</i>

95
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,051
<i>Father, however, was much changed.</i>

96
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,487
<i>But he hoped for better times.</i>

97
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,283
"And thence home,

98
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,962
"and my wife and I singing,
to our great content,

99
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,404
"and if ever there were a man
happier in his fortunes,

100
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,289
"I know him not."

101
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,481
Thus ends Mr. Pepys for today.

102
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,928
I do love a happy ending, don't you?

103
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,841
They're quite my favorite sort.

104
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,165
As well they should be.

105
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,681
Ella,

106
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:50,405
I have come to the conclusion
that it's time, perhaps,

107
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,203
to begin a new chapter.

108
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,165
Indeed, Father?

109
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,447
You'll recall that some time ago,
in my travels,

110
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,921
I made the acquaintance
of Sir Francis Tremaine.

111
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,280
Yes.

112
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,523
The Master of the Mercer's Guild,
is he not?

113
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,647
Was.

114
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,449
The poor man has died, alas.

115
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,845
His widow,

116
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,323
an honorable woman,

117
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,801
finds herself alone,

118
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,042
though still in the prime of her life.

119
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,848
You're worried about telling me.

120
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,203
But you mustn't be.

121
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,481
Not if it will lead to your happiness.

122
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,846
Yes.

123
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,050
Happiness.

124
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,330
Do you think
I may be allowed one last chance,

125
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,321
even though I thought
such things were done with for good?

126
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,960
Of course I do, Father.

127
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,122
She'll merely be your stepmother.

128
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,488
And you'll have two lovely sisters
to keep you company.

129
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,807
Have courage, be kind.

130
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,050
Welcome, ladies. Welcome!

131
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,885
She's skinny as a broomstick!

132
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,803
And that stringy hair!

133
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,520
You're very nice.

134
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,409
Welcome. I'm so happy to meet you.

135
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,482
You have such pretty hair.

136
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,927
- Thank you.
- You should have it styled.

137
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,001
I'm sure you're right.

138
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,684
- Would you like a tour of the house?
- What did she say?

139
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,564
She wants to show us
around her farmhouse.

140
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,405
- She's proud of it, I think.
- Do they keep animals inside?

141
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,649
How charming. How perfectly charming.

142
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,966
Lucifer.

143
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,891
<i>Her stepmother-to-be</i>

144
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:52,487
<i>was a woman of keen feeling
and refined taste.</i>

145
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,643
<i>And she, too, had known grief.</i>

146
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,405
<i>But she wore it wonderfully well.</i>

147
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:31,123
You did not say
your daughter was so beautiful.

148
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,885
She takes after her...

149
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,005
Her mother.

150
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,080
Just so.

151
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,282
What does Mummy mean?
What's so charming about it?

152
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,805
She's lying. That's just good manners.

153
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,961
Shut up.

154
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,560
How long has your family lived here?

155
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,687
Over 200 years.

156
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,762
And in all that time,
they never thought to decorate?

157
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,923
Anastasia, hush.

158
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,967
They'll think you are in earnest.

159
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,967
<i>Ella's stepmother,
high-spirited lady that she was,</i>

160
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,647
<i>set out to restore life
and laughter to the house.</i>

161
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,806
You are awful, Baron.

162
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,967
Fortune favors me again.

163
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:25,362
Well, look who's having
a party of their own.

164
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,445
Jacqueline, Teddy, Matilda,
greedy Gus-Gus.

165
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,045
Just what...

166
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,329
Yes, what do you think
you're up to, Lucifer?

167
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:43,564
Jacqueline is my guest,
and the eating of guests is not allowed.

168
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,846
Go on, now.

169
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,241
You've plenty of cat food
to keep you happy.

170
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,202
We ladies must help one another.

171
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,123
You're missing the party.

172
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,771
I imagine it's much
like all the other ones.

173
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,969
And I'm leaving first thing, El.

174
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,530
No. But you're...

175
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,126
You're hardly back from the last trip.

176
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,726
Do you have to go?

177
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,882
It's just a few months, my darling.

178
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,047
What would you like me
to bring you home from abroad?

179
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,485
You know, your sisters...

180
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,847
Stepsisters, have asked for

181
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,400
parasols and lace.

182
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,686
What will you have?

183
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,484
Bring me the first branch
your shoulder brushes on your journey.

184
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,401
That's a curious request.

185
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:39,041
Well, you'll have to take it with you
on your way

186
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,646
and think of me when you look at it.

187
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,006
And when you bring it back,
it means that you'll be with it.

188
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,761
And that's what I really want.

189
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,808
For you to come back.

190
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,201
No matter what.

191
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,411
I will.

192
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,209
Ella, while I'm away,

193
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,927
I want you to be good
to your stepmother

194
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,207
and stepsisters,
even though they may be

195
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,041
trying at times.

196
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,170
- I promise.
- Thank you.

197
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,166
I always leave a part of me behind, Ella.

198
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,851
Remember that.

199
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:27,367
And your mother's here, too,
though you see her not.

200
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,044
She's the very heart of this place.

201
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,767
And that's why
we must cherish this house,

202
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,444
always, for her.

203
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,330
I miss her.

204
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,245
Do you?

205
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,491
Very much.

206
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,127
Remember the lace!
I simply must have it!

207
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,770
And my parasol!

208
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,729
For my complexion!

209
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,406
That means skin, if you don't know!

210
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,891
Bye!

211
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,004
Bye. Ella!

212
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,127
I love you!

213
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,248
I love you, too!

214
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,930
Bye!

215
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,090
Ella, dear.

216
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,401
Now, now. Mustn't blub.

217
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,321
Yes, Stepmother.

218
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,368
You needn't call me that.

219
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,249
"Madam" will do.

220
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,209
There isn't room for me
and all of your clothes!

221
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,521
Well, then make yourself smaller!

222
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,444
Anastasia and Drisella
have always shared a room.

223
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,041
Such dear, affectionate girls.

224
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,725
Or... Or better yet, disappear entirely!

225
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,131
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

226
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,964
Sometimes I could scratch
your eyes out!

227
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:27,122
I think they're finding
the sleeping quarters rather confining.

228
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:31,647
Well, my bedroom's the biggest
besides yours and Father's.

229
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,048
Perhaps they'd like to share it.

230
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,602
What a wonderful idea.

231
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,842
What a good girl you are.

232
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,081
I can stay in the...

233
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,491
The attic.

234
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,326
Quite so.

235
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,921
The attic?

236
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Yes.

237
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,762
Only temporarily, while I have
all the other rooms redecorated.

238
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,444
The attic's so nice and airy

239
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,922
and you'll be away
from all of our fuss and bother.

240
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,240
You'd be even more cozy

241
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,723
if you kept all this bric-a-brac
up there with you.

242
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,249
Keep you amused.

243
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,721
Well,

244
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,881
no one shall disturb me here.

245
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,970
Hello, Gus-Gus.

246
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,082
Go on, Gus-Gus, you can do it.

247
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,004
So this is where you take refuge.

248
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,930
Me too, it would seem.

249
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,241
Right.

250
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,727
Who's going to help me?

251
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,801
Simpleton.

252
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,927
That is the last straw.

253
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,765
Our little sister, up there,
talking to the woodworm.

254
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,284
How very pleasant.

255
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,645
No cats,

256
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,442
and no stepsisters.

257
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,206
We have a halfwit for a sister.

258
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,520
I've got two.

259
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,090
I heard that.

260
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,128
- Who is she talking to?
- She's mad.

261
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,124
<i>Sing, sweet nightingale</i>

262
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,080
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Miss Ella.

263
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,804
Good morning, Tom!

264
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,211
<i>Sing sweet...</i>

265
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,442
Hello. Don't mind if I...

266
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,446
What a lovely Chantecler. Well done.

267
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,681
Thanks.

268
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,565
- 'Morning.
- 'Morning.

269
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,561
Thank you, Miss Ella.

270
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,846
You're welcome.

271
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,445
Ella!

272
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,330
Wake up, girls! It's lunchtime!

273
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,041
<i>Mornings did not agree
with Ella's stepsisters.</i>

274
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,045
<i>And they lacked accomplishment</i>

275
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,487
<i>in such domestic arts
as keeping house.</i>

276
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,525
<i>In fact, they lacked
accomplishment in any art.</i>

277
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:58,483
<i>It was a lover and his lass</i>

278
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,086
<i>With a hey, and a ho</i>

279
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,646
<i>And a hey nonino</i>

280
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:09,363
<i>That o'er the green
corn-field did pass</i>

281
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,290
<i>Sweet lovers love</i>

282
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,522
<i>The spring</i>

283
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,401
<i>Sweet lovers love</i>

284
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,485
<i>The spring</i>

285
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,525
Do shut up.

286
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,085
<i>Ella's great comfort</i>

287
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:10,562
<i>were the letters that Father
would send from his travels.</i>

288
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,802
<i>The weeks away
lengthened to months,</i>

289
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,248
<i>but every day would bring his
thoughts from some distant part.</i>

290
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,964
Miss Ella, it's the mail coach!

291
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,771
<i>Until late one afternoon...</i>

292
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,404
Farmer John?

293
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,051
Miss Ella.

294
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,083
It's your father, miss.

295
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,441
He took ill on the road.

296
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,129
He's passed on, miss.

297
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,045
He's gone.

298
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:43,129
To the end, he spoke only of you, miss.

299
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,761
And your mother.

300
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,881
I was to give you this.

301
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,882
But what about my lace?

302
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,803
My parasol?

303
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,131
Can't you see? None of that matters.

304
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,405
We're ruined.

305
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,685
How will we live?

306
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,485
Thank you.

307
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,811
It must have been very difficult for you.

308
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,283
<i>How indeed to live.</i>

309
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,408
<i>Economies had to be taken.</i>

310
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,802
<i>Ella's stepmother
dismissed the household.</i>

311
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:34,845
<i>Her stepmother and stepsisters
ever misused her.</i>

312
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,087
<i>And by and by they considered Ella</i>

313
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,570
<i>less a sister than a servant.</i>

314
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,650
<i>And so Ella was left to do all the work.</i>

315
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:53,124
<i>This was a good thing,
for it distracted her from her grief.</i>

316
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,601
<i>At least that was what
her stepmother said.</i>

317
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,289
<i>And she and her two daughters
were more than happy</i>

318
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:05,405
<i>to provide Ella
with lots and lots of distraction.</i>

319
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,001
<i>In their defense,</i>

320
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:17,283
<i>they did share with her
the very food they ate,</i>

321
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:21,009
<i>or rather, the scraps from their table.</i>

322
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,440
<i>She had little in the way of friends.</i>

323
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,048
<i>Well, her friends were very little.</i>

324
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,009
There you are.

325
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,683
Have dinner with me, won't you?

326
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,729
<i>But those friends she had,
she treated with an open heart</i>

327
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,643
<i>and an open hand.</i>

328
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,411
Your table.

329
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:07,364
<i>Sometimes, by the end of the day,</i>

330
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,887
<i>the drafty attic was too cold
to spend the night in,</i>

331
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,009
<i>so she lay by the dying
embers of the hearth</i>

332
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,730
<i>to keep warm.</i>

333
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,800
I thought breakfast was ready.

334
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,291
It is, madam.

335
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,362
I'm only mending the fire.

336
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,286
In future, can we not be called
until the work is done?

337
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,725
As you wish.

338
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,924
Ella, what's that on your face?

339
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,361
Madam?

340
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,162
It's ash from the fireplace.

341
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,530
Do clean yourself up.

342
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,485
You'll get cinders in our tea.

343
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,843
I've got a new name for her!
Cinderwench.

344
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,285
I couldn't bear to look so dirty.

345
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,771
Dirty Ella.

346
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,249
Cinder-ella!

347
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,886
That's what we'll call you.

348
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,562
Girls, you're too clever.

349
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,490
Who's this for?

350
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,561
Is there someone we've forgotten?

351
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,287
It's my place.

352
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:25,170
It seems too much
to expect you to prepare breakfast,

353
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,481
serve it and still sit with us.

354
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,848
Wouldn't you prefer to eat
when all the work is done, Ella?

355
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,241
Or should I say, "Cinderella"?

356
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,768
<i>Cinderella.</i>

357
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:25,287
<i>Names have power, like magic spells.</i>

358
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:28,043
<i>And of a sudden, it seemed to her</i>

359
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,327
<i>that her stepmother and stepsisters</i>

360
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,090
<i>had indeed transformed her</i>

361
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,481
<i>into merely a creature of ash</i>

362
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,800
<i>and toil.</i>

363
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,641
Run!

364
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,360
Quickly, my friend, or they'll catch you!

365
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,721
Go!

366
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:22,961
Easy!

367
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:29,001
<i>Perhaps it was just as well
that Ella's stepsisters were cruel.</i>

368
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,651
<i>For had she not run to the forest,</i>

369
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,404
<i>she might never have met the prince.</i>

370
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,845
Easy! Easy!

371
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,045
Easy, boy!

372
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,360
Come on, boy, slow down!

373
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,361
Miss!

374
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,010
Miss! Are you all right?

375
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,366
Hold on!

376
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,283
I'm all right, thank you!

377
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,521
That's fine.

378
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,210
- Are you all right?
- I'm all right,

379
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,800
But you've nearly frightened
the life out of him.

380
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,086
Who?

381
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,406
The stag.

382
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,690
What's he ever done to you
that you should chase him about?

383
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,644
I must confess
I've never met him before.

384
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,484
He is a friend of yours?

385
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,130
An acquaintance.

386
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,611
We met just now.

387
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,081
I looked into his eyes,

388
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,447
and he looked into mine,

389
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,490
and I just felt he had a great deal
left to do with his life.

390
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,560
That's all.

391
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,927
Miss, what do they call you?

392
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,205
Never mind what they call me.

393
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,444
You shouldn't be this deep
in the forest alone.

394
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:37,171
I'm not alone. I'm with you, Mister...

395
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,683
What do they call you?

396
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,884
You don't know who I am?

397
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,200
That is...

398
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,086
They call me Kit.

399
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,804
Well, my father does

400
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,325
when he's in a good mood.

401
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,767
And

402
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,081
where do you live, Mr. Kit?

403
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,161
At the palace.

404
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,806
My father's teaching me his trade.

405
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,251
You're an apprentice?

406
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,971
Of a sort.

407
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,885
That's very fine.

408
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,803
Do they treat you well?

409
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:06,121
Better than I deserve, most likely.

410
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,687
And you?

411
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,840
They treat me as well as they're able.

412
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,331
I'm sorry.

413
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,969
It's not your doing.

414
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,128
Nor yours either, I'll bet.

415
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,644
It's not so very bad.

416
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,201
Others have it worse, I'm sure.

417
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,721
We must

418
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:32,246
simply have courage
and be kind, mustn't we?

419
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,801
Yes.

420
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,365
You're right.

421
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,529
That's exactly how I feel.

422
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,328
Please don't let them hurt him.

423
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,131
But we're hunting, you see.
It's what's done.

424
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:53,329
Just because it's what's done
doesn't mean it's what should be done.

425
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,291
Right again.

426
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,806
Then,

427
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,887
you'll leave him alone, won't you?

428
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,886
I will.

429
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,286
Thank you very much, Mr. Kit.

430
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,841
There you are, Your High...

431
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,649
It's Kit! Kit!

432
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,848
Kit! I'm Kit. I'm on my way.

433
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,047
Well, we'd better get a move on,

434
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,844
Mr. Kit.

435
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,885
As I said.

436
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,566
On my way.

437
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,767
I hope to see you again, miss.

438
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,891
And I, you.

439
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,810
You sound as if you're the first fellow
ever to meet a pretty girl.

440
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,644
She wasn't a "pretty girl."

441
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,210
Well, she was a pretty girl,

442
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,566
but there was so much more to her.

443
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,881
How much more?
You've only met her once.

444
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,371
How could you know
anything about her?

445
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,602
You told me you knew right away
when you met Mother.

446
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,523
That's different.
Your mother was a princess.

447
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,726
You would have loved her anyway.

448
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,801
I would never have seen her,

449
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,922
because it wouldn't
have been appropriate.

450
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,527
And my father would have told me
what I'm telling you

451
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,640
and I would have listened.

452
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,721
- No, you wouldn't.
- Yes, I would.

453
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,767
- No, you wouldn't.
- I would.

454
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,040
- You wouldn't.
- You're right.

455
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,724
Well, how is he?

456
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,805
Your Majesty...

457
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,325
Never mind.

458
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,965
If it takes that long to work out a way
to say it, I already know.

459
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,166
Father...

460
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,009
Way of all flesh, boy.

461
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,081
Come.

462
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,480
We shall be late.

463
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,402
And punctuality is the...

464
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,608
...politeness of princes.

465
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,926
His Majesty, the King!

466
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,651
I'm sure your father spoke to you
of your behavior in the forest.

467
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,280
Is it any business of yours,
Grand Duke?

468
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,244
Your business is my business,
Your Royal Highness.

469
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,243
It will not do to let the stag go free.

470
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:46,369
Just because it's what's done
doesn't mean it's what should be done.

471
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,441
Or something like that.

472
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,848
Master Phineus,
master of the paintbrush,

473
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,921
patiently awaits.

474
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,082
Make him look marriageable,
Master Phineus.

475
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,089
We must attract a suitable bride,

476
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,771
even if he won't listen to a word I say.

477
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,286
I shall endeavor to please,
Your Majesty.

478
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,362
But I can't work miracles.

479
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,602
A splendid canvas, Master Phineus.

480
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,680
Thank you.

481
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,529
As if he knows anything about art.

482
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,285
So, these portraits
will really be sent abroad?

483
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:13,967
To induce the high and mighty
to attend this ball you insist upon.

484
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,247
Which is a tradition.
Which is beloved.

485
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,721
At which you will choose a bride.

486
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,040
Fascinating.

487
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:24,005
If I must marry, could I not wed, say,
a good, honest country girl?

488
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:28,130
How many divisions will this
"good, honest country girl" provide us?

489
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,328
How will she make
the kingdom stronger?

490
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:34,325
We are a small kingdom amongst
great states, Your Royal Highness.

491
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,731
And it's a dangerous world.

492
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,641
Listen, boy.

493
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,802
- Taking you up, Master Phineus.
- Good.

494
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,680
I want to see you and the kingdom safe.

495
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,409
All right, Father,

496
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,004
on one condition.

497
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:55,120
Let the invitations go to everyone,
not just the nobility.

498
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,441
The wars have brought sorrow on us all.

499
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,806
What do you think?

500
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,405
Would that please the people?

501
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,687
It's beyond my wit, Your Majesty.

502
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:05,923
But I wouldn't mind a bit of a jolly.

503
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,641
I think we might have made a bargain.

504
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,408
A ball for the people,

505
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,164
and a princess for the prince.

506
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:17,204
Sounds like a step in the right direction,
if you ask...

507
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,203
We didn't ask you.

508
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,011
I'm so sorry.
Naughty paint, naughty brush.

509
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,326
Down, please, Samson.

510
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,604
Haven't even got a cushion.

511
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,205
Right, down, down. Not that...

512
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,328
Oi! I'm on the ground.

513
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,768
I am literally on the ground. Sorry.

514
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,282
Actually this is
a very good angle for you.

515
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,522
Great nostrils.
Could I have a longer brush?

516
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,122
You don't look well, miss.

517
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,845
Not at all.

518
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,371
Why do you stay there,
when they treat you so?

519
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,965
Because I made my mother
and father a promise

520
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,566
to cherish the place we were so happy.

521
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,529
They loved our house

522
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,644
and now that they're gone,
I love it for them.

523
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,286
It's my home.

524
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,409
Hear ye! Hear ye!

525
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,161
Quiet!

526
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,881
"Know,

527
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:22,084
"on this day, two weeks hence,

528
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,925
"there shall be held, at the palace,

529
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,968
"a Royal Ball.

530
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:30,450
"At said ball,

531
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:33,729
"in accordance with ancient custom,

532
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:37,771
"the prince shall choose a bride.

533
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,760
"Furthermore,

534
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,922
"at the behest of the prince,

535
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,289
"it is hereby declared
that every maiden in the kingdom,

536
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:49,364
"be she noble or commoner,

537
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,807
"is invited to attend.

538
00:35:54,440 --> 00:36:00,163
"Such is the command
of our most noble king."

539
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,090
Excuse me, madam.

540
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:07,722
<i>Ella was enormously excited
to see Kit, the apprentice.</i>

541
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,007
<i>And her stepsisters
were mildly intrigued</i>

542
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,048
<i>by the notion of meeting the prince.</i>

543
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,891
I shall trick him into loving me.
See if I don't!

544
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,122
This is the most hugest news!

545
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,564
Calm yourselves.

546
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,485
Now listen to me.

547
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,642
One of you must win
the heart of the prince.

548
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,326
Do that, and we can unwind the debt
in which we were ensnared

549
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,845
when we came to this backwater!

550
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,083
I, a princess?

551
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,241
Or rather, I,

552
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,288
a princess?

553
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:39,922
Having delivered your news,
why are you still here?

554
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,729
You must return to town right away

555
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,849
and tell that seamstress
to run us up three fine ball gowns.

556
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,401
Three?

557
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,409
That's very thoughtful of you.

558
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,160
What do you mean?

559
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,844
To think of me.

560
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,046
Think of you?

561
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,521
Mummy, she believes
the other dress is for her.

562
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,762
Poor, slow, little Cinders.
How embarrassing.

563
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,603
You're too ambitious for your own good.

564
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,570
No. I only want to see my friend.

565
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,964
Let me be very clear.

566
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,841
One gown for Anastasia,

567
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,365
one for Drisella,

568
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,283
and one for me!

569
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,203
She doesn't know what that means.

570
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:26,726
Good. Right. That's settled then.

571
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,961
Now go!

572
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,281
Every girl in the kingdom
will be chasing the prince.

573
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:34,206
You must get there first before
the seamstress is drowning in work!

574
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,611
Tell me what she said, Drisella.

575
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,648
I speak French, not Italian!

576
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,288
Wake up, Your Royal Highness.
You're in a daze.

577
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,521
I'm sorry.

578
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,726
You've been off since the hunt.

579
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,724
It's that wonderful girl.
I can't stop thinking about her.

580
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,330
But there are plenty of girls.

581
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,926
But her spirit, her goodness...

582
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,411
You don't suppose
she has a sister, do you?

583
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,766
I don't know.

584
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,604
I don't know anything about her.

585
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:15,048
Perhaps your mystery girl
may come to the ball.

586
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,087
That is why you threw
the doors open, is it not?

587
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,527
Captain.
It was for the benefit of the people.

588
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,682
Of course. How shallow of me.

589
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,410
And if she comes, then what?

590
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,084
Then you will tell her you're a prince.

591
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,766
And a prince may take
whichever bride he wishes.

592
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:29,921
- Ha!
- Ha?

593
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,001
Yes, "ha."

594
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,451
You know my father
and the Grand Duke

595
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,284
will only have me marry a princess.

596
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:37,887
Well, if this girl from the forest
is as charming as you say,

597
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,240
they may change their minds.

598
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,122
<i>The day of the ball arrived</i>

599
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:49,285
<i>and the entire kingdom
held its breath in anticipation.</i>

600
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,331
<i>You want me to be your queen?</i>

601
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,931
Who? Me?

602
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,326
Tighter.

603
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,685
Tighter!

604
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,361
Tighter.

605
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,331
That's it!

606
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,124
A vision, sister.

607
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,486
Likewise.

608
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,369
We must compete for the prince's hand.

609
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:09,046
But let it not mean we harbor
dark thoughts against each other.

610
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,690
Of course not, dear sister.

611
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:15,121
I wouldn't dream of poisoning you
before we leave for the ball.

612
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,851
Nor I of pushing you from
a moving carriage on the way there.

613
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:22,323
Or I of dashing your brains out
on the palace steps as we arrive.

614
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,084
We are sisters, after all.

615
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:27,004
And blood is so much thicker
than water.

616
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,923
We shall let the prince decide.

617
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,729
What will he be like, I wonder?

618
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,329
What does it matter what he's like?

619
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,050
He's rich beyond reason.

620
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:40,490
Wouldn't you like to know
a bit about him before you marry him?

621
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,961
Certainly not. It might change my mind.

622
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,884
I bet you have never
ever spoken to a man.

623
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,883
Have you, moon-face?

624
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,209
I have, once.

625
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,361
To a gentleman.

626
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,730
Some menial, no doubt.

627
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,365
Some 'prentice.

628
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,851
He was an apprentice, yes.

629
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:59,207
All men are fools,
that's what Mama says.

630
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,884
The sooner you learn that, the better.

631
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,287
The first dance, milady?

632
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,047
Prince Charming, you're so naughty!

633
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,764
- I want to try it.
- No, I'm wearing it.

634
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,205
No! No!

635
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,040
<i>Not for the first time,</i>

636
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:24,408
<i>Ella actually felt pity
for these two schemers,</i>

637
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:29,327
<i>who could be every bit as ugly within
as they were fair without.</i>

638
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:30,887
My prince!

639
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:31,960
He will love me!

640
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,968
But I will be his queen!

641
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:40,289
<i>If her stepmother
would not have a fourth dress made,</i>

642
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:43,125
<i>it seemed to Ella
that there was no reason why</i>

643
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,806
<i>she would not try to run it up herself.</i>

644
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:50,850
<i>And besides, she did have a little help.</i>

645
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,047
My dear girls.

646
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,005
To see you like this,

647
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:20,324
it makes me believe
one of you might just snare the prince.

648
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,847
And to think
I have two horses in the race!

649
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:28,924
I daresay no one in the kingdom
will outshine my daughters.

650
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,811
Cinderella?

651
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,609
It cost you nothing.

652
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,407
It was my mother's old dress, you see.

653
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,925
And I took it up myself.

654
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,604
Cinderella at the ball!

655
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,648
No one wants a servant for a bride.

656
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,245
After all I've done...

657
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:49,130
I don't want to ruin anything.
I don't even want to meet the prince.

658
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,170
And you won't, because
there's no question of your going.

659
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:55,648
But, all of the maidens
of the land are invited,

660
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,529
by order of the king.

661
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:00,251
It is the king I am thinking of.

662
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,482
It would be an insult
to the royal personage

663
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,803
to take you to the palace
dressed in these old rags.

664
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,166
Rags?

665
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,250
This was my mother's.

666
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,643
I'm sorry to have to tell you

667
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,650
but your mother's taste
was questionable.

668
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:19,969
This thing is so old-fashioned

669
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,760
it's practically falling to pieces.

670
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,321
The shoulder's frayed.

671
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,767
- It's falling to bits.
- And this!

672
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:30,082
It's a ridiculous, old-fashioned joke!

673
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,605
How could you?

674
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,086
How could I otherwise?

675
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:40,365
I will not have anyone
associate my daughters with you.

676
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,680
It would ruin their prospects

677
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,491
to be seen arriving
with a ragged servant girl.

678
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,690
Because that is what you are.

679
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,967
And that is what you will always be.

680
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,963
Now mark my words!

681
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:54,520
You shall not go to the ball!

682
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,450
Go on, get going!

683
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,810
I'm sorry, Mother.

684
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,005
I'm sorry.

685
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,931
I said I'd have courage, but I don't.

686
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,490
Not anymore.

687
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:40,683
I don't believe anymore.

688
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:00,401
Excuse me.

689
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,729
Can you help me, miss?

690
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:08,089
Just a little crust of bread,
or better, a cup of milk?

691
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,521
Yes.

692
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:13,762
Yes, yes, yes.
I think I can find something for you.

693
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:23,491
Why are you crying?

694
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,050
It's nothing.

695
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,644
Nothing?

696
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:31,721
Nothing.

697
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:34,246
What is a bowl of milk? Nothing.

698
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:37,767
But kindness makes it everything.

699
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:52,685
Now, I don't mean to hurry you,
but you really haven't got long, Ella.

700
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,929
How do you know me?

701
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:56,761
Who are you?

702
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:58,160
Who am I?

703
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:00,408
I should think
you'd have worked that one out.

704
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,129
I'm your hairy dogfather.

705
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,089
I mean, fairy godmother!

706
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:08,921
You can't be.

707
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:10,401
Why not?

708
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,484
They don't exist.

709
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:15,481
They're just made up for children.

710
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:17,927
Didn't your own mother
believe in them?

711
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,360
Don't say no, because I heard her.

712
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:20,921
You heard her?

713
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,123
Fiddle-faddle, fiddle-faddle.

714
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:25,447
Right! First things first.

715
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,640
Let me slip into something
more comfortable.

716
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,001
That's better.

717
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:50,648
Now, where was I?

718
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:51,881
How did you...

719
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:54,088
Yes. Let's see.

720
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:57,960
What we need is something
that sort of says, "coach."

721
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:01,641
That trough?

722
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,650
Doesn't really say "coach."

723
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:07,081
No, no, I'm liking fruit and veg.

724
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,611
Do you grow watermelons?

725
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:09,681
No.

726
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:10,761
Cantaloupe?

727
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:11,921
I don't even know what that is.

728
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,286
Artichoke?

729
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:14,521
Kumquat?

730
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:15,726
Beef tomato?

731
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,482
We do have pumpkins.

732
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:22,601
Pumpkins?

733
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,091
This will be a first for me.

734
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,321
Always interesting.

735
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:27,890
I don't usually work with squashes.

736
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:29,007
Too mushy.

737
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:34,930
Let me see. That'll do. Yes. Knife?

738
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,606
- There you are.
- Thank you, darling.

739
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:41,681
Hello, my strangely orange
vegetable friend.

740
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:42,807
A quick snip for you.

741
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:44,681
Lovely!

742
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,171
Heavy pumpkin!

743
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:48,285
Look out, mices!

744
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:51,761
Well. Never mind.

745
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:52,921
Let's do it here.

746
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,206
Do what here?

747
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:55,930
Turn the pumpkin into a carriage.

748
00:46:58,200 --> 00:46:59,247
You're making me nervous, actually.

749
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:01,209
- Shall I shut my eyes?
- It might be better.

750
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,080
For heaven's sake.
Let's just go for it.

751
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:11,289
Well, something's definitely happening.

752
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:12,725
You see, the trick is...

753
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,362
Actually, I've forgotten what the trick is.

754
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:19,643
I just thought, if it...

755
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:21,484
If it does get much bigger...

756
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:22,607
Yes?

757
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:24,527
Hang on.

758
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:30,125
Is that what you meant to do?

759
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,208
Do you think that's what I meant to do?

760
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:33,281
Run! Run, darling!

761
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:41,721
Take cover!

762
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:04,250
There! One carriage.

763
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:07,645
You really are my fairy godmother.

764
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:08,807
Of course.

765
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,247
I don't go about transforming
pumpkins for just anybody.

766
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:14,043
Now, where are those mice?

767
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:15,924
- Mice?
- Yes.

768
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:17,451
Mice, mice, mice.

769
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:18,607
There they are.

770
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:20,444
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

771
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:33,603
Four white chargers.

772
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:35,882
Gus-Gus, how fine you look!

773
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,650
But how did you...

774
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:39,086
Now, where are we?

775
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:42,721
Got carriage, horses... Footmen!

776
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:44,561
Footmen?

777
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:47,404
Hello, lovely Mr. Lizard.

778
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:48,925
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

779
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,564
Hello!

780
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:00,810
You called?

781
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:05,090
Now, I need that coachman.

782
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:06,400
Coachman?

783
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,369
Did I say "coachman"? I meant "goose."

784
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,408
I can't drive. I'm a goose.

785
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:20,885
Now, shoo!

786
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:23,965
Everyone into place, no time to be lost!

787
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:26,045
Come on!

788
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:29,361
Fairy Godmother!

789
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:31,360
Yes, what?

790
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:33,491
My dress.

791
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:35,330
I can't go in this dress.

792
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:37,084
- Can you mend it?
- Mend it?

793
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,804
No, no. I'll turn it into something new.

794
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,769
No, please don't.

795
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:42,808
This was my mother's.

796
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:46,361
And I'd like to wear it
when I go to the palace.

797
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,527
It's almost like taking her with me.

798
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,211
I understand.

799
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:57,050
But she wouldn't mind
if I gee it up a bit?

800
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:59,049
Wouldn't mind a nice blue?

801
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,406
No.

802
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:43,241
There.

803
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:45,409
It's beautiful.

804
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:47,205
She'd love it.

805
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,447
Now, come on. Off you go. Quick!

806
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:51,931
You'll be late!

807
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:56,131
I'm very new at this!

808
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:57,606
Oh, boy.

809
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,928
Stop that blooming coach!

810
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:09,125
Thank you.

811
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:10,761
Just a moment!

812
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:14,085
Are those the best you have?

813
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:16,290
It's all right. No one will see them.

814
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:18,240
No, they'll ruin the whole look.
Quick, quick.

815
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,528
Take them off.
Really quite hideous.

816
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:22,887
Let's have something new for a change.

817
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:24,041
I'm rather good at shoes.

818
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:35,641
But...

819
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:38,682
They're made of glass?

820
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:40,001
Yes.

821
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:42,443
And you'll find
they're really comfortable.

822
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:44,643
Ella, you really must go now.

823
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:46,601
Fairy Godmother?

824
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:48,011
What is it?

825
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:49,400
My stepmother and the girls?

826
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:50,641
Don't worry.

827
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:53,485
I'll make sure they don't recognize you.

828
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:55,561
Now, off you go.

829
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,207
For you shall go to the ball.

830
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,568
In you get. So lovely.

831
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:05,170
Do stop wittering on.

832
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:10,721
Ella!

833
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:11,926
I almost forgot.

834
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,447
Remember, the magic
will only last so long.

835
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:17,841
With the last echo of the last bell,

836
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:19,684
at the last stroke of midnight,

837
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:21,922
the spell will be broken

838
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,401
and all will return to what it was before.

839
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:26,086
Midnight?

840
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:27,286
Midnight.

841
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,409
That's more than enough time.

842
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:31,884
- Off you go then.
- Thank you.

843
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,047
Thank you.

844
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:36,208
Goosey, go!

845
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:40,001
Good bye!

846
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:37,206
Chandeliers, aloft!

847
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:53,085
Princess Mei Mei of Fujian.

848
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:59,087
Princess Shahrzad of the Seljuqs.

849
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:00,571
Your Highness!

850
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:05,249
Princess Chelina of Zaragosa!

851
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:09,487
Princess Imani of Shona!

852
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:16,331
Princess Hiina
of the Chrysanthemum Throne!

853
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:23,488
Lady Tremaine and her daughters.

854
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:30,047
The Lady Tremaine and her daughters.

855
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:31,161
I'm Drisella.

856
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:32,241
And I'm Anastasia.

857
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:33,560
- People will want to know.
- I'm the clever one.

858
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:35,165
I'm very beautiful.

859
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:38,689
The very clever Miss Drisella,

860
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:42,082
and the very beautiful Anastasia.

861
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:44,443
Do come on!

862
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:51,489
The Lord Veneering.

863
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:54,648
Who are you looking for?

864
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:57,241
No one.

865
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:00,561
It's that girl in the forest, isn't it?

866
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:03,644
That's why you were so generous
with the invitations.

867
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:05,210
Father, it was for the people.

868
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:07,891
I know you love the people, Kit.

869
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:12,322
But I also know
that your head's been turned.

870
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:16,121
But you've only met her once,
in the forest.

871
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:19,044
And you would have me
marry someone I met once, tonight.

872
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:20,645
A princess.

873
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:23,121
It's a princess or nothing.

874
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:30,484
Hold the doors! One more coming in.

875
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:44,608
May I present Her Royal Highness,

876
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:47,763
the Princess Chelina of Zaragosa.

877
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:54,643
You are as handsome as your picture.

878
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:57,891
And your little kingdom is enchanting.

879
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:03,244
I hope the princess will not find
our "little kingdom" too confining.

880
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:10,250
Miss Ella.

881
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,290
Thank you.

882
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:26,649
I'm frightened, Mr. Lizard.

883
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:32,003
I'm only a girl, not a princess.

884
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:35,410
And I'm only a lizard, not a footman.

885
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:38,489
Enjoy it while it lasts.

886
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:04,881
Your Majesty, Your Royal Highness,

887
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,368
My Lords, ladies and gentlemen,

888
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:13,324
distinguished visitors
and people of our land,

889
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:18,088
the prince shall now choose his partner
for the first dance.

890
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:21,921
Let our ball commence!

891
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:55,204
Excuse me.

892
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:58,401
A thousand apologies,
Your Royal Highness.

893
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:00,005
I don't know what happened.

894
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,525
Mr. Kit.

895
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,490
It's you,

896
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:12,767
isn't it?

897
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:15,283
Just so.

898
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:19,003
Your Highness...

899
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:22,481
If I may,

900
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:23,925
that is,

901
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:29,204
it would give me the greatest pleasure,

902
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:32,887
if you would do me the honor
of letting me lead you through this...

903
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:34,200
the first...

904
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:39,325
Dance?

905
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:41,245
Yes, dance.

906
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:43,611
That's it.

907
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:07,369
They're all looking at you.

908
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:11,684
Believe me, they're all looking at you.

909
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:22,609
Who is she?

910
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:24,285
I have no idea.

911
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:28,566
Who's that, Mama?

912
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:31,206
I'm not exactly sure,
but this does not bode well.

913
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:32,725
That's a lovely dress she's got on.

914
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:34,564
- And how pretty she is.
- Concentrate!

915
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:37,564
You must turn the prince's head,
you fools! Now, get out there!

916
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:38,926
But no one's asked us to dance.

917
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,047
Gentlemen.

918
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:41,281
May I present my daughters,

919
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:43,402
- Anastasia, Drisella.
<i>- Mademoiselle.</i>

920
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:45,369
Off you go!

921
01:02:58,160 --> 01:02:59,571
Smile.

922
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:08,161
Come with me.

923
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:10,482
Over there. Smile.

924
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:17,170
So, you're the prince!

925
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:21,491
Not "the prince," exactly.

926
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:24,006
There are plenty of princes in the world.
I'm only a prince.

927
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:27,042
But your name's not really Kit.

928
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:29,202
Certainly it is,
and my father still calls me that,

929
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:31,851
when he's especially un-peeved at me.

930
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:34,287
But you're no apprentice.

931
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:35,850
I am. An apprentice monarch.

932
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:37,445
Still learning my trade.

933
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:39,566
Oh, gosh!

934
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:41,449
Look, please forgive me.

935
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:43,602
I thought you might treat me
differently if you knew.

936
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:45,967
I mistook you
for a good, honest country girl,

937
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:49,328
and now I see you didn't want
to overawe a plain soldier.

938
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:51,129
Little chance of that.

939
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:52,884
No more surprises?

940
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:56,565
No more surprises.

941
01:03:58,560 --> 01:03:59,891
Is that you?

942
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:02,327
I hate myself in paintings. Don't you?

943
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:04,969
No one's ever painted my portrait.

944
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:07,566
No? Well, they should.

945
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:11,847
Who is she?

946
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:13,160
She gave no name, Your Grace.

947
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:14,241
You didn't ask?

948
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:16,322
I was out of breath, Your Grace,
on account of introducing

949
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:18,482
Princess Blodwyn
of Llanfairpwllgwyngyll...

950
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:20,722
- Shut up, will you?
- "Shut up." Absolutely.

951
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:27,003
I don't believe this!

952
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:30,564
No! Not her!

953
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:37,323
Won't they miss you at the ball?

954
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:39,806
Maybe.

955
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:42,129
But let's not go back just yet.

956
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:47,251
What's wrong?

957
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:49,921
When I go back,

958
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,209
they will try to pair me off
with a lady of their choosing.

959
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:55,806
I'm expected to marry for advantage.

960
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:57,766
Well, whose advantage?

961
01:04:57,840 --> 01:04:59,683
That is a good question.

962
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:04,523
Well, surely you have a right
to your own heart.

963
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:07,206
And I must weigh that
against the king's wishes.

964
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:11,126
He's a wise ruler and a loving father.

965
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:14,690
Well, perhaps he'll change his mind.

966
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:22,006
I fear he hasn't much time to do so.

967
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:25,324
Poor Kit.

968
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:29,880
People are saying she's a princess.

969
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:32,406
Our prince seems quite taken with her.

970
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:34,209
She went straight for him.

971
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:36,768
You have to appreciate her efficiency.

972
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:40,731
But surely, if she is a princess,
this may be good.

973
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:46,450
I've already promised him in marriage,
to the Princess Chelina.

974
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:48,326
But...

975
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:52,649
Forgive me, Your Grace.

976
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:55,081
I did not mean to intrude.

977
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:59,082
No, it's you who have
to forgive me, madam.

978
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:01,888
Your secret is safe with me.

979
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:16,922
I've never shown this place to anyone.

980
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:25,043
A secret garden.

981
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:29,965
I love it!

982
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:38,521
Please.

983
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:40,804
No, I shouldn't.

984
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:41,927
You should.

985
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:44,441
- I shouldn't.
- You should.

986
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:45,806
I will.

987
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:56,561
May I?

988
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:57,926
Please.

989
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:26,845
It's made of glass.

990
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:29,090
And why not?

991
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:30,601
Allow me.

992
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:32,609
Thank you.

993
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:45,081
There.

994
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:46,841
There.

995
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:54,285
Won't you tell me who you really are?

996
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:57,649
If I do, I think
everything might be different.

997
01:07:57,960 --> 01:08:00,964
I don't understand.
Can you at least tell me your name?

998
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:03,211
My name is...

999
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:10,210
I have to leave.

1000
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:12,165
It's hard to explain.

1001
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:15,968
Lizards and pumpkins, and things.

1002
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:20,120
Wait!

1003
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:23,041
Where are you going?

1004
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:25,483
You've been awfully nice.

1005
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:27,688
Thank you for a wonderful evening.
I've loved it.

1006
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:29,006
Every second!

1007
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:40,845
"Lizards and pumpkins."

1008
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:01,566
Excuse me.

1009
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:03,722
Sorry! Terribly sorry.

1010
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:05,281
My goodness!

1011
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:09,404
My prince!

1012
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:13,684
You've got the wrong one!

1013
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:15,441
He needs her name!

1014
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:16,561
I know he needs her name.

1015
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:18,609
Her name, you ninny. Get her name!

1016
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:20,444
That really hurt!

1017
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:22,441
Your Majesty.

1018
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:23,681
Young lady.

1019
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:24,807
I am so sorry.

1020
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:26,370
Think nothing of it, my dear.

1021
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:30,644
I wanted to say, Your Majesty,

1022
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:33,280
your son Kit
is the most lovely person I ever met.

1023
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:35,244
So good and brave.

1024
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:38,127
I hope you know
how much he loves you.

1025
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:40,725
Excuse me!

1026
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:01,405
Wait!

1027
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:07,764
Wait!

1028
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:09,201
Where are you going?

1029
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:10,606
Hurry, hurry!

1030
01:10:13,240 --> 01:10:14,924
Come back!

1031
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:18,081
Hurry!

1032
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:22,641
Hurry, please, Mr. Goose!

1033
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:25,931
Wait!

1034
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:31,602
Watch out!

1035
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:38,361
Captain, my horse.

1036
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:39,521
No!

1037
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:42,604
This may be some intrigue
to lure you from the palace.

1038
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:44,689
Your father needs you here.

1039
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:47,006
Captain!

1040
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:48,525
I was having a fine old time.

1041
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:51,007
You had to go and choose that one,
didn't you?

1042
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:54,529
Yes, I did.

1043
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:21,926
Hurry, Mr. Goose!

1044
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:23,286
Come on!

1045
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:26,926
Hee-ya!

1046
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,684
Be careful, Mr. Goose!

1047
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:34,241
Oh, my goodness!

1048
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:46,047
You there! Stop in the name of the king!

1049
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:49,090
Such bad timing.

1050
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:54,320
Halt there!

1051
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:55,521
I know what to do!

1052
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:58,161
Yes!

1053
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:00,520
Get this thing open!

1054
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:06,881
Oh, dear!

1055
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:18,846
No, no, no.

1056
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:34,126
I'm sorry.

1057
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:37,805
You'll find it's very comfortable.

1058
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:05,089
Do shut up!

1059
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:08,481
Cinderella!

1060
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:11,484
Cinderella!
We'll have to wake her up.

1061
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:13,845
Cinderella!

1062
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,809
Wake up, lazy bones!

1063
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:17,928
Tea and a plate of biscuits.

1064
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,240
Welcome back!

1065
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:21,288
- You look cheerful!
- And wet!

1066
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,082
I took a walk in the rain
to cheer myself up.

1067
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:25,161
Typical.

1068
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:26,287
Tea.

1069
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:28,881
We did not communicate
through mere words.

1070
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:30,086
Our souls met.

1071
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:32,766
Precisely.
My soul and the prince's soul.

1072
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:34,365
Your soul was over
by the banquet tables.

1073
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:36,204
You didn't see him dance with me.

1074
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:39,648
Dance with you?
He didn't even speak to you.

1075
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:42,121
It was not our fault, Mother.
It was that girl.

1076
01:14:42,280 --> 01:14:43,691
The mystery princess.

1077
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:45,524
Mystery princess?

1078
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,684
My, what a charming notion.

1079
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:49,365
She was no princess.

1080
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:52,683
She was a preening interloper
who made a spectacle of herself.

1081
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:56,128
A vulgar, young hussy
marched into the ball,

1082
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:58,522
unaccompanied, if you will,

1083
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:01,120
and to the horror of everyone,
threw herself at the prince.

1084
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:03,482
And he actually danced
with the ugly thing.

1085
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:04,681
- Yes?
- Yes.

1086
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:05,807
It was pity.

1087
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:08,690
He was too polite to send her packing
in front of everyone, you see.

1088
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:12,771
But not wanting to expose us
to the presumptuous wench any further,

1089
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:14,490
- he took her apart.
- And told her off.

1090
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:15,971
But she refused to leave

1091
01:15:16,040 --> 01:15:19,044
and the palace guards
chased her from the party!

1092
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:21,802
I pity the prince. Such bad taste.

1093
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:23,405
They belong with each other.

1094
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:24,970
Well, it's no matter, girls.

1095
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:27,526
The ball was a mere diversion.

1096
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:29,364
The prince is not free to marry for love.

1097
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:33,482
He's promised to the
Princess Chelina of Zaragosa.

1098
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:36,208
The Grand Duke told me himself.

1099
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:38,328
It's so very unfair.

1100
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:40,330
Yes.

1101
01:15:40,760 --> 01:15:43,081
The way of the world.

1102
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:49,762
Hello again.

1103
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:02,445
Thank you for your help.

1104
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:05,283
It really was like a dream.

1105
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:07,762
Better than a dream.

1106
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:27,361
<i>Ella couldn't wait to write down
all that had happened,</i>

1107
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:30,683
<i>so that she might remember
every single bit of it</i>

1108
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:34,086
<i>just as if she were telling
her mother and father</i>

1109
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:38,529
<i>about the palace ball
and her time with the prince.</i>

1110
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:45,725
<i>Above all, the prince.</i>

1111
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:11,010
You've come.

1112
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:12,687
Good.

1113
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:16,091
Father.

1114
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:18,331
Don't go.

1115
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:20,851
I must.

1116
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:23,928
You needn't be alone.

1117
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:26,608
Take a bride.

1118
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:29,047
The Princess Chelina.

1119
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:32,763
What if I commanded you to do so?

1120
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:37,763
I love and respect you, but I will not.

1121
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:44,164
I believe that we need not
look outside of our borders

1122
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:46,527
for strength or guidance.

1123
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:49,441
What we need is right before us.

1124
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:55,525
And we need only have courage
and be kind to see it.

1125
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:00,205
Just so.

1126
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:05,247
You've become your own man.

1127
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:06,880
Good.

1128
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:12,209
And perhaps, in the little time left to me,

1129
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:15,210
I can become the father you deserve.

1130
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:21,844
You must not marry for advantage.

1131
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:26,767
You must marry for love.

1132
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:32,763
Find that girl.

1133
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:34,771
Find her.

1134
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,526
The one they're all talking about.

1135
01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:39,205
The forgetful one

1136
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:41,328
- who loses her shoes.
- ...loses her shoes.

1137
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:50,127
Be cheerful, boy.

1138
01:18:52,280 --> 01:18:54,442
Thank you, Father.

1139
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:56,882
Thank you, Kit.

1140
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:03,728
I love you, son.

1141
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:07,289
I love you, Father.

1142
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:43,371
<i>Once the time for mourning
had passed,</i>

1143
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:45,886
<i>a proclamation was sent out.</i>

1144
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:49,567
Hear ye! Hear ye!

1145
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:52,001
Hear ye!

1146
01:19:57,640 --> 01:19:59,847
Know that our new king

1147
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:03,606
hereby declares his love for

1148
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:08,651
the mysterious princess

1149
01:20:09,240 --> 01:20:10,321
as wore

1150
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:13,763
glass slippers to the ball.

1151
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:19,165
And requests that she present herself
at the palace,

1152
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:23,530
whereupon, if she be willing,

1153
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:29,121
he will forthwith marry her

1154
01:20:30,280 --> 01:20:33,966
with all due ceremony.

1155
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:12,084
Are you looking for this?

1156
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:16,045
There must be quite a story to go with it.

1157
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:17,610
Won't you tell me?

1158
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:19,081
No?

1159
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:21,171
All right then.

1160
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:23,766
I shall tell you a story.

1161
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:26,444
Once upon a time,

1162
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:29,285
there was a beautiful young girl

1163
01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:31,882
who married for love.

1164
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:35,010
And she had two loving daughters.

1165
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:37,123
All was well.

1166
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:40,921
But, one day, her husband,

1167
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:43,771
the light of her life, died.

1168
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:45,965
The next time,

1169
01:21:46,120 --> 01:21:49,124
she married for the sake
of her daughters.

1170
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:53,285
But that man, too, was taken from her.

1171
01:21:53,480 --> 01:21:59,123
And she was doomed to look
every day upon his beloved child.

1172
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:02,200
She had hoped to marry off

1173
01:22:02,280 --> 01:22:06,888
one of her beautiful,
stupid daughters to the prince.

1174
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:10,806
But his head was turned
by a girl with glass slippers.

1175
01:22:11,480 --> 01:22:12,891
And so,

1176
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:16,920
I lived unhappily ever after.

1177
01:22:19,160 --> 01:22:21,891
My story would appear to be ended.

1178
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:25,404
Now, tell me yours.

1179
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:27,491
Did you steal it?

1180
01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:29,487
No.

1181
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:31,321
It was given to me.

1182
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:32,401
Given to you?

1183
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:34,482
Given to you. Nothing is ever given.

1184
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:36,483
For everything, we must pay and pay.

1185
01:22:36,680 --> 01:22:38,091
That's not true.

1186
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:42,124
Kindness is free. Love is free.

1187
01:22:42,280 --> 01:22:44,282
Love is not free.

1188
01:22:44,840 --> 01:22:48,765
Now, here is how you will pay me,

1189
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:50,922
if you are to have what you desire.

1190
01:22:52,120 --> 01:22:56,762
No one will believe you,
a dirty servant girl without a family,

1191
01:22:56,920 --> 01:22:59,287
if you lay claim to the prince's heart.

1192
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:02,011
But with a respectable gentlewoman
to put you forward,

1193
01:23:02,120 --> 01:23:03,690
you will not be ignored.

1194
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:05,446
When you are married,

1195
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:09,206
you will make me
the head of the royal household.

1196
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:12,443
Anastasia and Drisella
we will pair off with wealthy lords.

1197
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:15,683
And I shall manage that boy.

1198
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:18,049
But he's not a boy.

1199
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:20,370
And who are you?

1200
01:23:20,720 --> 01:23:22,882
How would you rule a kingdom?

1201
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:24,166
Best to leave it to me.

1202
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:27,566
That way we all get what we want.

1203
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:29,887
No.

1204
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:35,325
No?

1205
01:23:36,240 --> 01:23:38,129
I was not able to protect
my father from you,

1206
01:23:38,240 --> 01:23:40,720
but I will protect the prince
and the kingdom,

1207
01:23:41,560 --> 01:23:43,369
no matter what becomes of me.

1208
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:46,882
Well, that is a mistake.

1209
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:49,845
No!

1210
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:51,246
Why?

1211
01:23:52,200 --> 01:23:54,567
Why are you so cruel?

1212
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:57,164
I don't understand it.

1213
01:23:57,240 --> 01:23:59,083
I've tried to be kind to you.

1214
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:00,925
You? Kind to me?

1215
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:02,161
Yes.

1216
01:24:02,240 --> 01:24:04,607
And though no one
deserves to be treated

1217
01:24:04,680 --> 01:24:06,409
as you have treated me.

1218
01:24:07,160 --> 01:24:08,730
Why do you do it?

1219
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:12,680
Why?

1220
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:18,240
Because you are young,
and innocent, and good.

1221
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:19,925
And I...

1222
01:24:24,680 --> 01:24:27,126
No!

1223
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:34,129
May I ask where you got this?

1224
01:24:34,280 --> 01:24:36,931
From a ragged servant girl
in my household.

1225
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:41,124
The mystery princess is a commoner.

1226
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:46,285
You could imagine when I discovered
her subterfuge how horrified I was.

1227
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:48,566
You told no one else?

1228
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:51,361
Not even my own daughters.

1229
01:24:52,040 --> 01:24:54,930
No one need ever know the truth.

1230
01:24:55,080 --> 01:24:58,641
You've spared the kingdom
a great deal of embarrassment.

1231
01:24:59,480 --> 01:25:02,450
And I should like to keep it that way.

1232
01:25:02,720 --> 01:25:04,404
Are you threatening me?

1233
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:06,166
Yes.

1234
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:14,605
So what do you want?

1235
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:17,482
I should like to be a countess.

1236
01:25:18,240 --> 01:25:22,245
And I require advantageous marriages
for my two daughters.

1237
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:24,646
Done.

1238
01:25:27,480 --> 01:25:28,641
And the girl?

1239
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:32,127
Do with her what you will.

1240
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:34,605
She's nothing to me.

1241
01:25:36,240 --> 01:25:38,527
- Where?
- Abandoned on the side of the road.

1242
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:40,040
- And have you found her?
- The girl?

1243
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:41,525
No, she's disappeared.

1244
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:43,728
There must be some reason
she vanished.

1245
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:45,723
Perhaps she has been prevented
from speaking.

1246
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:46,926
Do not lose heart, Kit.

1247
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,844
On the contrary,
lose heart and gain wisdom.

1248
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:53,124
The people need to know
that the kingdom is secure.

1249
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:56,529
That the king has a queen,
and the land may have an heir.

1250
01:25:57,040 --> 01:25:58,883
They want to face the future
with certainty!

1251
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:00,962
Agreed!
Then let us be certain.

1252
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:02,530
I am king.

1253
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:05,285
I say we shall seek out
the mystery princess,

1254
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:07,124
even if she does not want to be found.

1255
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:08,884
I have to see her again.

1256
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:10,724
But if she's not found,

1257
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:15,210
then for the good of the kingdom,
you must marry the Princess Chelina.

1258
01:26:16,120 --> 01:26:17,406
For the good of the kingdom.

1259
01:26:29,640 --> 01:26:31,324
Very well, agreed.

1260
01:26:31,480 --> 01:26:32,891
But Your Highness...

1261
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:39,890
But you will spare no effort.

1262
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:43,244
Your Majesty, of course.
You have my word.

1263
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:04,521
Next.

1264
01:27:09,720 --> 01:27:12,963
<i>The slipper traveled
the length and breadth of the kingdom,</i>

1265
01:27:14,280 --> 01:27:16,362
<i>visiting every maiden
both high and low,</i>

1266
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:18,727
<i>and every sort in between.</i>

1267
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:20,121
Oh, Lord!

1268
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:21,361
You first, madam.

1269
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:24,011
Well, I'll give it a go.

1270
01:27:24,120 --> 01:27:26,566
Right. I say. Where do you want me?

1271
01:27:28,240 --> 01:27:29,651
Up! Up I go.

1272
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:33,006
Careful, my foot's a bit swollen.
I've been...

1273
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:38,082
It's the yeast.

1274
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:41,210
<i>The Grand Duke was true to his word.</i>

1275
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:45,001
<i>He spared no effort
to demonstrate to the prince</i>

1276
01:27:45,080 --> 01:27:47,651
<i>that the mystery princess
was not to be found.</i>

1277
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:48,721
It fits!

1278
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:50,768
- It doesn't fit you.
- It does fit!

1279
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:52,001
- It doesn't fit.
- It's mine!

1280
01:27:52,120 --> 01:27:54,521
- I am the mystery princess!
- Give back the shoe.

1281
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:55,567
Take the shoe away from her!

1282
01:27:55,640 --> 01:27:56,846
Don't take the shoe away from me,
please, please!

1283
01:27:56,920 --> 01:27:58,160
Please, it's my shoe!

1284
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:00,650
Make way for the slipper!

1285
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,161
Can I try the other foot?

1286
01:28:11,240 --> 01:28:12,526
I don't think so.

1287
01:28:13,400 --> 01:28:15,687
<i>But whatever they tried,</i>

1288
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:19,606
<i>the magical slipper refused to fit
even the most eligible of maidens.</i>

1289
01:28:19,680 --> 01:28:22,331
We found the mystery princess for ya!

1290
01:28:32,520 --> 01:28:34,284
What's wrong, Captain?

1291
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:37,169
We haven't found the girl.

1292
01:28:37,480 --> 01:28:39,050
I'm disappointed for our king.

1293
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:41,407
Come on, now! Don't lose heart.

1294
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:43,130
There's one more house.

1295
01:28:43,680 --> 01:28:46,206
We must leave no stone unturned.

1296
01:28:47,320 --> 01:28:49,129
- Horses!
- Horses!

1297
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:52,010
Mother, it's our chance!

1298
01:28:55,440 --> 01:28:57,249
Let them in!

1299
01:29:09,680 --> 01:29:12,968
Gentlemen! What a wonderful surprise.

1300
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:14,929
A moment of your time, good lady.

1301
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:16,968
Of course, Your Grace.

1302
01:29:17,080 --> 01:29:19,082
Please. This way.

1303
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:22,971
<i>Ella did not know who was downstairs.</i>

1304
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:24,405
<i>Nor did she care.</i>

1305
01:29:25,400 --> 01:29:27,004
<i>For surely no one had come to see her.</i>

1306
01:29:27,080 --> 01:29:28,241
Jacqueline, stop it!

1307
01:29:35,640 --> 01:29:36,687
It shrunk.

1308
01:29:37,880 --> 01:29:39,006
Try again.

1309
01:29:48,240 --> 01:29:49,605
Enough!

1310
01:29:51,480 --> 01:29:52,845
<i>You must love me...</i>

1311
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:55,969
<i>Though Ella was sad,
her spirit was not broken.</i>

1312
01:29:56,040 --> 01:29:58,008
<i>She knew that the ball,</i>

1313
01:29:58,120 --> 01:29:59,451
<i>and her time with the prince,</i>

1314
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:02,091
<i>would become
beautiful, distant memories,</i>

1315
01:30:02,160 --> 01:30:04,640
<i>like those of her father and mother,</i>

1316
01:30:04,720 --> 01:30:07,007
<i>and her golden childhood.</i>

1317
01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:18,649
It fits me!

1318
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:20,761
Bad luck, miss.

1319
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:24,329
<i>Lavender's green
dilly, dilly</i>

1320
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:27,051
<i>Lavender's blue</i>

1321
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:31,324
<i>You must love me
dilly, dilly</i>

1322
01:30:31,480 --> 01:30:33,482
<i>For I love you</i>

1323
01:30:34,720 --> 01:30:35,801
<i>Very well.</i>

1324
01:30:35,880 --> 01:30:37,325
Our task is done, Captain.

1325
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:41,606
But fate may yet be kind to us, girls.

1326
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:45,080
Indeed, madam!

1327
01:30:45,160 --> 01:30:48,084
<i>When I am king
dilly, dilly</i>

1328
01:30:48,160 --> 01:30:50,367
<i>You shall be queen</i>

1329
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:53,484
<i>Lavender's green
dilly, dilly</i>

1330
01:30:53,560 --> 01:30:55,324
<i>Lavender's blue</i>

1331
01:30:56,960 --> 01:30:58,928
<i>If you love me</i>

1332
01:30:59,040 --> 01:31:00,121
<i>Dilly, dilly</i>

1333
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:02,680
<i>I will love you</i>

1334
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:06,684
<i>Let the birds sing
dilly, dilly</i>

1335
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:09,451
<i>And the lambs play</i>

1336
01:31:10,160 --> 01:31:12,845
<i>We shall be safe
dilly, dilly...</i>

1337
01:31:14,200 --> 01:31:15,884
Do you hear that, Your Grace?

1338
01:31:16,920 --> 01:31:18,001
Let's be off, Captain.

1339
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:19,286
Just a moment.

1340
01:31:22,680 --> 01:31:23,761
Madam,

1341
01:31:24,040 --> 01:31:27,123
there is no other maiden in your house?

1342
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:30,725
None.

1343
01:31:31,880 --> 01:31:33,928
Then has your cat learned to sing?

1344
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:44,169
There's been enough play-acting today,
Captain. Let's be off.

1345
01:31:44,240 --> 01:31:46,208
But she's lying, Your Grace.

1346
01:31:46,280 --> 01:31:48,886
Nonsense! I trust the lady.
We're leaving.

1347
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:50,086
Grand Duke!

1348
01:31:55,360 --> 01:31:57,442
Your Majesty.

1349
01:31:57,560 --> 01:32:01,042
What sweet singing.
Makes me want to tarry just a little.

1350
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:03,524
Your Majesty, I did not know...

1351
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:05,523
Captain, would you be so kind
as to investigate?

1352
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:09,286
It would be my pleasure, Your Majesty.

1353
01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:13,726
<i>If you love me
dilly, dilly</i>

1354
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:15,569
<i>I will love you</i>

1355
01:32:17,400 --> 01:32:19,482
There! You see?

1356
01:32:19,560 --> 01:32:21,847
I told you
it was no one of any importance.

1357
01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:23,649
We'll see about that.

1358
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:26,681
Miss.

1359
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:33,251
You are requested and required
to present yourself to your king.

1360
01:32:33,360 --> 01:32:35,169
I forbid you to do this!

1361
01:32:35,240 --> 01:32:37,607
And I forbid you to forbid her!

1362
01:32:38,520 --> 01:32:40,284
Who are you to stop
an officer of the king?

1363
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:42,370
Are you an empress?

1364
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:43,961
A saint?

1365
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:45,925
A deity?

1366
01:32:46,440 --> 01:32:48,044
I am her mother.

1367
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:55,443
You have never been

1368
01:32:56,680 --> 01:32:59,650
and you never will be my mother.

1369
01:33:03,960 --> 01:33:05,485
Come now, miss.

1370
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:13,449
Just remember who you are,
you wretch!

1371
01:33:28,080 --> 01:33:32,324
<i>Would who she was,
who she really was, be enough?</i>

1372
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:35,290
<i>There was no magic
to help her this time.</i>

1373
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:38,921
<i>This is perhaps the greatest risk
that any of us will take.</i>

1374
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:42,561
<i>To be seen as we truly are.</i>

1375
01:33:43,560 --> 01:33:47,690
<i>Have courage, and be kind.</i>

1376
01:34:27,920 --> 01:34:29,410
Who are you?

1377
01:34:31,240 --> 01:34:33,083
I am Cinderella.

1378
01:34:36,040 --> 01:34:37,644
Your Majesty,

1379
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:41,729
I'm no princess.

1380
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:45,043
I have no carriage,

1381
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:47,730
no parents,

1382
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:50,409
and no dowry.

1383
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:54,564
I do not even know
if that beautiful slipper will fit.

1384
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:56,165
But

1385
01:34:58,080 --> 01:34:59,605
if it does,

1386
01:35:01,400 --> 01:35:03,846
will you take me as I am?

1387
01:35:05,240 --> 01:35:07,766
An honest country girl who loves you.

1388
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,002
Of course I will.

1389
01:35:11,240 --> 01:35:14,323
But only if you will take me as I am.

1390
01:35:14,520 --> 01:35:16,522
An apprentice still learning his trade.

1391
01:35:18,720 --> 01:35:19,767
Please.

1392
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:06,726
Cinderella!

1393
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:07,961
Ella!

1394
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:12,322
My dear sister! I'm sorry.

1395
01:36:12,480 --> 01:36:14,289
So very sorry.

1396
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:32,006
Shall we?

1397
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:14,245
I forgive you.

1398
01:37:23,800 --> 01:37:24,961
<i>Forgiven or not,</i>

1399
01:37:25,040 --> 01:37:27,930
<i>Cinderella's stepmother
and her daughters</i>

1400
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,002
<i>would soon leave with the Grand Duke,</i>

1401
01:37:30,080 --> 01:37:33,209
<i>and never set foot
in the kingdom again.</i>

1402
01:37:41,720 --> 01:37:43,563
They would have loved each other.

1403
01:37:43,640 --> 01:37:46,041
We must have a portrait of you painted.

1404
01:37:46,120 --> 01:37:48,726
No. I do hate myself in paintings.

1405
01:37:48,840 --> 01:37:49,966
Be kind.

1406
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:53,009
And have courage.

1407
01:37:53,080 --> 01:37:54,844
And all will be well.

1408
01:38:02,320 --> 01:38:03,526
Are you ready?

1409
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:06,444
For anything, so long as it's with you.

1410
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:19,010
My queen.

1411
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:20,760
My Kit.

1412
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:36,600
<i>And so Kit and Ella were married,</i>

1413
01:38:36,720 --> 01:38:39,644
<i>and I can tell you,
as her fairy godmother,</i>

1414
01:38:39,720 --> 01:38:41,131
<i>that they were counted to be</i>

1415
01:38:41,200 --> 01:38:46,047
<i>The fairest and kindest rulers
the kingdom had known.</i>

1416
01:38:46,240 --> 01:38:50,643
<i>And Ella continued to see
the world not as it is,</i>

1417
01:38:50,720 --> 01:38:52,848
<i>but as it could be,</i>

1418
01:38:52,920 --> 01:38:55,810
<i>if only you believe in courage</i>

1419
01:38:55,880 --> 01:38:59,202
<i>and kindness and occasionally,</i>

1420
01:38:59,280 --> 01:39:03,285
<i>just a little bit of magic.</i>

1421
01:45:13,080 --> 01:45:14,525
<i>Where did everyone go?</i>

1
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,179
- Time's up.
- Wait.

2
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,179
Is the truck loaded?

3
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:54,819
Yes, ma'am.

4
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,819
Come on. I got a plane to catch.

5
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,579
Well, if you don't leave now
you're going to miss your flight

6
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:01,084
and then he's going to
be late for school.

7
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,691
Come on. Come on. Game's up.

8
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,406
Come on!

9
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:08,179
You got three days left to counter.

10
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:08,779
Wait.

11
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:11,739
You have to wait, you!

12
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:14,688
Wait. Wait. Wait.

13
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:19,921
Hey.

14
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,179
Your grand-dad gave me that.

15
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:25,459
I always use it when I travel.

16
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,930
Can I have it when you get back?

17
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:30,360
Yeah, man.

18
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,739
And we'll finish the game, okay?

19
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,404
Don't re-set it.

20
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,939
Okay. Ask Grandpa when he's
going to come and visit.

21
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:42,521
I will. I got to go.

22
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,299
I love you.

23
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,819
Okay. I got to get...

24
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:51,939
Got to go, got to go.
Call me when you land.

25
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:55,681
Will do. I love you.

26
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,366
I love you, too.

27
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:00,059
You okay?

28
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,121
Yeah.

29
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,059
Okay. See you on Friday.

30
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,121
Yeah.

31
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,487
- Say hi to dad.
- Will do.

32
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,619
Come on Honey.

33
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:28,888
Got to go. Got to go.

34
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,379
Morning, kiddo.

35
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,247
Yo.

36
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,019
You heard from daddy this morning?

37
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,001
No.

38
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,859
Still thinking?

39
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:53,699
Yeah.

40
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,619
I got to move, but I think I
can check mate him in three.

41
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,059
Oh, yeah?

42
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,339
Yeah.

43
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,939
What's the move?

44
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:04,969
First move pawn five to pawn three.

45
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,979
What is it?

46
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,739
You okay?

47
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,005
Hi, Mrs. Whyte.

48
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,286
Hey Grace.

49
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,219
Hey.

50
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,659
Did you grab the brownies I made?

51
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:26,779
Yeah.

52
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:27,979
Have a good day.

53
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,927
You too.

54
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,539
Hi. Leave a message.

55
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,979
Hey, it's me.

56
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,859
Haven't heard from
you since yesterday.

57
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,539
Hope the conference is going well.

58
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,179
We're going to see you tonight.

59
00:03:54,180 --> 00:04:02,009
And making something special for
supper, so come home hungry.

60
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:05,322
Love you. Bye.

61
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,219
Look what I made.

62
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:14,499
It can go light speed
fast by forming a portal

63
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,739
through these generators.

64
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:19,579
One creates negative energy and
the other one creates positive.

65
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:21,459
That's nice.

66
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:23,819
Look. And there's room
for the both of us.

67
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,051
Let me see.

68
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:28,459
What's that?

69
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:32,523
For when they have a baby, but
they don't make Lego babies yet.

70
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,419
Um...

71
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:41,259
ls there milk in it?

72
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,059
Yeah.

73
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,459
Jere, you want a brownie?

74
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,725
Yes.

75
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,339
You're not having any?

76
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,765
Not if you aren't.

77
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,059
Hey. It's me.

78
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,579
We've been waiting for an hour.

79
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:22,164
Call me when you get this.

80
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,811
Bye.

81
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:38,419
Flight 767 from Newark,

82
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:41,019
have all the passengers
come off the flight yet?

83
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:44,161
Uh... Yeah.

84
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,699
Maintenance crews are on board.

85
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,299
We've been here for over an hour,

86
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,219
My husband's on that flight
and he hasn't come out yet.

87
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,939
Maybe he's stuck in customs.

88
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,899
This happens all the time.

89
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:59,299
Unfortunately, there's nothing
we can really do from here.

90
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,659
Okay.

91
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,607
Thank you.

92
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,539
Is he here?

93
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:12,569
No. Not yet, kiddo.

94
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,259
Empire Place.

95
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:28,779
Hi.

96
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:31,099
I'd like to enquire about
a client who's there

97
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,699
for the Relativistic
Dynamics conference.

98
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,419
His name's Gabriel Whyte.

99
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:38,979
W-h-y-t-e.

100
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,739
Yes, ma'am.

101
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:43,927
Can you tell me what
time he checked out?

102
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:47,761
Mr. Whyte is still checked in.

103
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:50,979
He is?

104
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:53,179
I'm dialling through.
There's no answer.

105
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,779
Would you do me a favour
and send somebody

106
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:59,081
to check that he's not there?

107
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,659
He was supposed to be
on a flight tonight

108
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,739
and I'm waiting for him at
the airport in Toronto.

109
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,379
Sure, I'll have someone
go to his room.

110
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:06,619
Shall I put you on hold?

111
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:09,602
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.

112
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,059
What happened?

113
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,179
Not sure. Daddy's late.

114
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,139
Housekeeping checked his room.

115
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,883
He's not there but his luggage is.

116
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,579
And he hasn't left any messages?

117
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,891
No ma'am.

118
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:32,659
Hello?

119
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,779
Hey, Dad...

120
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:34,979
Oh hi, sweetie.

121
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:37,939
Have you seen Gabe the
last couple of days?

122
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:42,579
'Cause I'm at Pearson and he was supposed
to come off the flight and he hasn't.

123
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,819
So I called the hotel and they
said that he's still checked in.

124
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:49,859
- But his phone's turned off and...
- I saw him right after he landed.

125
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,699
I took him to a work
space on campus

126
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,379
and just left him.

127
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,339
We were supposed to have
lunch the next day,

128
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,499
but he didn't answer his phone
so I figured he was busy.

129
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,739
Something's wrong.

130
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,059
He called me yesterday morning

131
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,619
and I haven't heard from him since.

132
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,179
Okay. I'll... I'll...

133
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,499
I'll see what I can find out
and I'll call you back.

134
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,659
Okay.

135
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,019
Tell Grandpa I said hi.

136
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,699
- Okay, I heard him.
- Hi, Erol.

137
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,779
He says hi.

138
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,179
- Bye, Dad.
- Thank you.

139
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:15,889
- Okay.
- Good bye.

140
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:35,179
Gabriel Whyte. Newark.

141
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:38,419
He left Wednesday morning.

142
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:40,059
- No.
- I haven't spoken to him to date.

143
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:43,379
The last time anyone spoke to
him was my father in Princeton.

144
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,019
Look, you're the police.

145
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:48,446
Aren't you supposed to
be doing something?

146
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,299
Hey, Joanne, it's me.

147
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,099
Hi.

148
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:19,059
Can I ask you a huge favour?

149
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:23,404
Would you watch Erol for a couple of
days for me while I go to Princeton?

150
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,459
He called after landing,
checked into his hotel,

151
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:31,681
came to my office,
then we came here.

152
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,619
Well, have the police
been here yet?

153
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:34,259
Not yet.

154
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,899
I didn't even know
this place existed.

155
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,139
He's the one who showed it to me.

156
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,939
I just gave him access and left.

157
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,683
He said he wanted a
quiet place to work.

158
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,979
This definitely was not here.

159
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:48,929
Whatever it is, it must be his.

160
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,099
Did he have those crates with him?

161
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,729
Shrink-wrapped, yeah.

162
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,800
Dad...

163
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,051
Yeah?

164
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,819
It's his wallet and his phone.

165
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,927
We need to get the
police here right away.

166
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:46,131
I want to maybe talk to people
that he knew on campus.

167
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,484
I don't know what to do.

168
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,059
Hey, Professor.

169
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:22,699
I pulled those boxes we were talking about.
Just let me know where you want them.

170
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,219
Okay. I'll catch up with you.

171
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,539
I need to get back.

172
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:29,099
Listen, we'll find him.

173
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,684
Dad, it's been three days.

174
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,379
The police are baffled and...

175
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:38,966
Marika, we'll figure it out.

176
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,527
Thanks, Dad.

177
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,299
Call me later.

178
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,201
Bye.

179
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:04,099
Hi.

180
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,240
Hi.

181
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,659
This place hasn't changed.

182
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,259
Yeah, it's my grand-dad's legacy.

183
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,739
We've kept it exactly
how he made it.

184
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,019
You want a coffee?

185
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:15,251
Uh, yeah.

186
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,219
Um, can I ask you a question?

187
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:21,167
Sure.

188
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,126
Sorry.

189
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:31,099
You haven't seen this guy in
here in the past couple of days?

190
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:35,925
Uh... No. Sorry.

191
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:38,285
Yes, coming right up.

192
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:17,379
Is that your report card?

193
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,339
Dad!

194
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,979
Hey, peanut.

195
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:22,325
Give us a look.

196
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,765
Can I see yours?

197
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,570
Yeah, all right.

198
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,579
Why were you away so much?

199
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:48,084
Because I never came home.

200
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,441
Erol?

201
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,859
You okay?

202
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:07,444
Yes. Strange dream.

203
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:14,299
This is Marika. Please
leave a message.

204
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,779
Hey, Mom. I'm just checking in.

205
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:19,259
Hope the lecture went well.
Have a safe flight.

206
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,366
Bye.

207
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,859
Was it about your mom?

208
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:29,888
No, I just forgot to
call her earlier.

209
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:33,806
Was it about how you haven't
studied for your finals?

210
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:37,371
No need to dream about reality.

211
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,445
Mom?

212
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,819
Mom?

213
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:43,819
Yeah?

214
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:46,099
Hey. Welcome back.

215
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,299
You just get in?

216
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,979
Yeah.

217
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,499
Want breakfast?

218
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,243
Thanks. That would be great.

219
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,259
Right. Come down whenever.

220
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,241
Okay.

221
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:11,979
Morning, kiddo.

222
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:14,405
Hey. Good morning.

223
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:18,459
Oh, thank you.

224
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:21,488
Didn't you have class today?

225
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,448
I cancelled. I was too tired.

226
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,979
Didn't sleep on the plane?

227
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:29,245
Not much lately.

228
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:32,739
There's another
letter here from MIT.

229
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,059
Have you accepted yet?

230
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,939
Told you, I'm just
not a Red Sox fan.

231
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,299
Oh, honey.

232
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,659
You can't let this go by.

233
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:42,005
We'll talk about this later.

234
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:47,779
By the way, there's a message from
Dr. Wong's office on the machine.

235
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:51,059
- Did you miss your appointment last week?
- I'm not seeing Dr. Wong anymore.

236
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,699
Why not?

237
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:57,339
Because I never blacked out
once from the medication

238
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:02,131
but he is keeping my
driver's license.

239
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,779
And I'm sick of taking the bus.

240
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:08,887
So you want to change medications?

241
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:12,207
Well, I'd like to stop altogether.

242
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:15,219
As in, you've already stopped?

243
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,167
Yep.

244
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:20,888
I'd like to feel like myself again.

245
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,739
You're not eating?

246
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:26,419
No.

247
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,739
I already did.

248
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:29,299
Let's talk about this later, okay?

249
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,419
Bye.

250
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,299
- Thank you.
- Welcome back.

251
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,939
Bye. Have a good day.

252
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:35,001
You too.

253
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,760
Okay.

254
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:11,979
Anyone.

255
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:15,939
It would take weeks to
even organize a work flow.

256
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:18,779
What if I gave you my approach?

257
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:19,699
Did it work?

258
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,204
No, no. You have to tell me.

259
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,099
Oh, Mr. Whyte.

260
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,539
Only two minutes left.

261
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,139
Why even bother?

262
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:28,779
Sorry, sir.

263
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:32,619
Well, since you obviously
don't need my instruction,

264
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:35,443
why don't you tell us the answer?

265
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,459
It... it's unsolvable.

266
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,139
You have one too many variables.

267
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:44,202
We need to know the
value of Z at least.

268
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:47,899
Okay.

269
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,579
That's good for today.

270
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:52,369
Mr. Whyte. Can I have a word?

271
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,539
I'm listening.

272
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,459
I'm sorry.

273
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:14,459
What was so important this time?

274
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:17,019
Is this Grandpa Sal
asking, or Professor Sal?

275
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,779
Uh, both.

276
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:19,979
I was helping Grace.

277
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:22,689
She has her thesis
defense coming up.

278
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:25,539
Sometimes I feel like you're
taking advantage of your sweet,

279
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,539
good-natured grandfather.

280
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:30,608
- Don't give me any special treatment.
- I... I'm not sure how to treat you.

281
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,819
You spend all your time
with your girlfriend.

282
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,619
You never hand in assignments,
half the time you don't even

283
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:39,379
show up And yet you ace
every one of my exams.

284
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:42,219
How did you see the problem
on the board so quickly?

285
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:44,859
- Just did.
- Well, how?

286
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,339
I don't know how.

287
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:49,379
I can see it like a
colour out of place.

288
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:53,443
You need to know Z
otherwise it's a dead end.

289
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:00,499
What about this?

290
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,765
Can you do it?

291
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:06,299
Yeah. Yeah, I can do this.

292
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,659
I'm going to need a few hours.

293
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:09,299
Great.

294
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:12,419
It took me a week.

295
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:15,926
And I'll bet you come up
with the same answer.

296
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:20,819
Erol, can I show you something?

297
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,484
It's in the lab.

298
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,604
You need a maid, Grandpa?

299
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,166
Okay.

300
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:39,419
All right, look, I need you
to listen very carefully

301
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,939
to what I'm going to say.

302
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:41,779
I...

303
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,899
I need you to be open to
the craziest possibilities.

304
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:46,619
Things you dreamed of as a child.

305
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:52,619
There are multiple universes
and we live in one of them,

306
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:57,539
one track, at one
point in space time.

307
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,419
Now, before your father
left for Princeton...

308
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,219
My father?

309
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:00,899
Just listen.

310
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:06,459
Before he left I believe
he found a way to move

311
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:10,619
back and forth on that track.

312
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:11,459
What?

313
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,899
He stabilized a
traversable wormhole,

314
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,699
moved the accelerated
end of that wormhole

315
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:22,208
into the past and
travelled through it.

316
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:27,659
It's an accelerator.

317
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:30,179
I found it in one of those
boxes in the storage room

318
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:30,819
at Princeton.

319
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:35,008
They were sitting there for
54 years when I found them.

320
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,659
This display had the
last coordinates

321
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:41,939
where I believe your father
arrived, stored in its memory.

322
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:47,899
GPS coordinates of exactly where
I found it minus 19,655 days

323
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,859
from when I found it.

324
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,619
I've... I've been trying to
make this work for years

325
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,659
but there were missing
parts and I... I...

326
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,699
- I don't have all your father's notes.
- You're saying that my father...

327
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:01,605
I'm saying your father
flew to Princeton...

328
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:09,059
put this together and went back
to the calendar year 1946.

329
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,539
Something must have
happened to him there

330
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:12,619
otherwise he would have returned
the instant he left and...

331
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:14,939
and we wouldn't have even
perceived his absence.

332
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,139
What happened to him?

333
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,979
I don't know.

334
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:20,019
How... how... how could
this be possible?

335
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,739
If I knew that exactly, I'd
have fixed this years ago.

336
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:25,859
But I'm not a specialist
in quantum mechanics.

337
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:29,179
I've had to learn about black
holes and cosmic strings

338
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:31,899
from scratch and I
still can't solve

339
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,699
some of these fundamental problems.

340
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:36,379
It says he created
negative energy, but I...

341
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:37,979
I have no idea how.

342
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:40,484
Why are you telling me this now?

343
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,445
What is this?

344
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:53,339
You have a gift, Erol.

345
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,939
More so, than your father even.

346
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:58,059
I didn't want to have
to ever tell you this,

347
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:00,739
I'd have much preferred
you just live your life.

348
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,499
I can't do this alone.

349
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,739
If you help me I think
we can figure it out.

350
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,219
There is no proof.

351
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:08,406
There is proof.

352
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:17,299
These were in one of the boxes.

353
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:20,579
If you want to test this against your
father's handwriting, be my guest.

354
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,179
This mold, the... the ink...

355
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:24,099
it's 67 years old.

356
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,099
And I've transcribed all of
your father's research notes.

357
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:26,899
It's... it's...

358
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,899
it's revolutionary,
never been done before.

359
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,529
And... and look at this!

360
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:39,099
I think he was planning
to meet with Einstein.

361
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:43,499
I... I know I'm asking a lot,
but the pay-off, Erol,

362
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,899
everything will be corrected.

363
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:49,859
- What do you mean "corrected"?
- I mean, we're living in a negative space.

364
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:52,339
Gabe should be here now.

365
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:57,484
Your mother, you, me, none of
us should be living this life.

366
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:04,619
Gabe disappeared in 2000.

367
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:07,619
Anyone who was affected
by that is living.

368
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:10,139
An alternate reality.

369
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,219
We fix this, we bring him back.

370
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,979
It'll all return to normal.

371
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:17,819
The last 12 years of
our lives will go back

372
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:20,290
to what they were supposed to be.

373
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,659
You really believe this?

374
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,579
Yes.

375
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:28,499
Grandpa, you know how much mom
struggles forgetting about him.

376
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,731
This is a fantasy.

377
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,499
Have you told any of this to her?

378
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,243
No. I've only told you.

379
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:41,842
I'm... I'm begging you
to keep it that way.

380
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:44,081
Erol...

381
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:09,083
You'll probably never
forgive yourself.

382
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,459
Hi. Sorry, I'm late.

383
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,771
It's okay. I just got here.

384
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,899
You okay?

385
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:20,059
Yeah. Did you talk to your Prof?

386
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,299
Presenting in two weeks.

387
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,699
Oh well, I'll... I'll help.

388
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,299
No, you've... you've done enough.

389
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:27,059
Just show up to the presentation.
I need a friendly face there.

390
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:29,371
Yeah, I'll be there.

391
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,419
We still on for tonight?

392
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:34,059
Yeah, if you want. You
seem kind of preoccupied.

393
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:38,219
No. No. I really had my
heart set on seeing...

394
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,579
what was it again?

395
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,179
A one-man show about
the Bhopal disaster.

396
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:44,481
Yes. Yes. Exactly
what I wanted to see.

397
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,459
Hi.

398
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:50,779
Hi. So... you want to
tell me what's up?

399
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:53,489
No. Tell me... tell me
what research you did.

400
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:58,459
Mostly just the details on the GNHs
of the three countries I'm studying.

401
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:01,362
Since it's a theoretical
model, the data has...

402
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:06,579
So what are you working
on now, Professor?

403
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:10,059
I take an old family photograph

404
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:12,419
and I paint a picture
of that image.

405
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:16,699
And then I make digital copies
of it over and over again,

406
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:20,019
each time removing elements to it.

407
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:23,099
And then I... I go back
to the original painting

408
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:26,899
and take the figures out
as if they weren't there

409
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,499
to begin with.

410
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,899
So you're altering your
own memory sources.

411
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:33,689
Something like that, yeah.

412
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,539
Hi, honey.

413
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,419
Hello.

414
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,539
Do you want to join us?

415
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:39,659
That's all right.
I got to get somewhere.

416
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,259
Here, let me take these for you.

417
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:42,459
You still going?

418
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:44,619
Yeah, in a second.

419
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:45,379
Thanks, honey.

420
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:48,169
Excuse me for one minute.

421
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:53,690
Would you mind if I checked
out your work station?

422
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:58,202
You don't have to say
anything, just listen.

423
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:01,686
I've spent years on this.

424
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:03,779
Everything I've done
is based on evidence

425
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,819
your father left behind.

426
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:08,722
Let me walk you
through his research.

427
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,011
Who's this?

428
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:23,005
My husband.

429
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,179
Is he...?

430
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:26,411
He's dead.

431
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:30,090
We should get going.

432
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:36,169
Just think about what
I've been saying, please.

433
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,921
Thank you, Professor.

434
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:40,699
Good night.

435
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:43,090
Thank you for coming.

436
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:59,322
They admire you so much.

437
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:02,859
I remember when you dreamed
of becoming an artist.

438
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:05,091
Now you're doing it.

439
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:08,288
That wasn't my dream, Pops.

440
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:10,979
You okay?

441
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:13,006
Yeah. Why?

442
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:15,531
You seem distant.

443
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:21,219
Just, you know, been
away these three days.

444
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:28,446
Marika, you work too hard.

445
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,645
Thanks for dinner.

446
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,219
It was takeout.

447
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:37,566
Yeah, but it was really
delicious takeout.

448
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,219
Erol, see you in class?

449
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,259
Yeah.

450
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:45,321
Good night.

451
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:59,419
Okay, I'll be late.

452
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:01,739
Do you ever think about your dad?

453
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,766
What?

454
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,050
We never talk about him.

455
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:10,339
We don't have to talk about him.

456
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:12,571
Please.

457
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:15,370
I'd like to.

458
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,939
Did Gramps say something
to you tonight?

459
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:22,205
About what?

460
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:24,366
Nothing.

461
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:27,890
So you've been thinking
about dad a lot.

462
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:30,401
Yeah.

463
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:35,283
It all came flooding back...

464
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,411
at the airport.

465
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:45,723
I remember we played chess.

466
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:50,008
Went to the movies twice a month.

467
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,099
On... on science nights
he'd teach me the concepts

468
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,570
using my toys.

469
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:01,771
He loved me.

470
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:04,499
It's weird, but I...

471
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:09,086
I don't remember what he
looked like, you know,

472
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:12,248
just photographs and stuff.

473
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:18,401
Do you ever get angry
about what happened?

474
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:21,568
Mom, I don't think about it.

475
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:27,641
Did I ever tell you how we met?

476
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,259
No, not really.

477
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:35,139
You know, it was when we were
still living in Princeton

478
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:40,619
and pops dragged me to some event

479
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,779
that I didn't want to go to.

480
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:44,219
I think...

481
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:48,602
I think mom had just died,
like a couple of months before

482
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:52,647
and he wanted to get
me out of the house.

483
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:59,968
Well, he introduced me
to his prize student.

484
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:05,699
It was love at first
sight, just like

485
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:08,648
when mom and dad got married.

486
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:15,579
And he asked me to marry him
a month later at this old diner

487
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,891
we used to go to.

488
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:24,299
I resisted at first 'cause
he was a workaholic

489
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:27,487
and wanted to change the world.

490
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:33,419
I thought he wouldn't
have time for a family.

491
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:36,019
But you know what he said?

492
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:36,979
What?

493
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:41,299
He could change the world and
be home for supper every night.

494
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,884
And he was.

495
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:48,779
He was so confident.

496
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:51,379
Do you remember?

497
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,779
Yeah.

498
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:55,523
Such a dreamer.

499
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:59,768
Nothing was impossible.

500
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:08,059
You know, I have this recurring
dream about the night

501
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:10,779
that he didn't come home,

502
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:14,286
where he calls and tells
me what happened.

503
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:18,283
What happened?

504
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:20,446
Well...

505
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:25,289
he fell in love.

506
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:32,403
Or he hit his head and had amnesia.

507
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:38,520
Or he just wanted a different
life, not with us.

508
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:53,721
Mom...

509
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:56,844
you can't do this.

510
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:01,241
You're off the medication,
it's putting you in a rut.

511
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,859
They're not helping.

512
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:06,524
I don't want to feel numb.

513
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:12,805
It's just that, you know, your dad,

514
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:17,019
he never broke a promise, ever.

515
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:22,219
And I just, I remember his
face at the airport so vividly

516
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,539
and the way that he looked at me.

517
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:26,419
- It just looked like he knew something.
- You can't... you can't do this again.

518
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:28,179
- But... You can't think like that.
- I just want to know!

519
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:28,939
It doesn't matter.

520
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:32,379
- It's... that's the only thing I want!
- It doesn't matter. You can't...

521
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:37,171
What difference does it make?
He's gone! He's dead.

522
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:53,488
This time I'm late.

523
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,659
I can't go.

524
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,179
What is it?

525
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:01,525
My mom...

526
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:04,931
Is she okay?

527
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:07,804
I shouldn't leave her alone.

528
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:12,163
Is that what you were
trying to tell me earlier?

529
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,968
You want to know why
I'm not going to MIT?

530
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:20,649
I can't leave her alone.

531
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:25,249
I wish it were different.

532
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:28,579
I'm sorry. I know we had plans.

533
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:31,179
Sometimes it's hard not to
take everything you do for me

534
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:33,219
for granted.

535
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:37,806
Of all people, you don't
have to apologize.

536
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:47,970
You know, I've been carrying
this around for weeks.

537
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:51,019
I was going to give it to
you after grad, but, I...

538
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:53,001
I just can't wait.

539
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:02,847
Have you had this all these years?

540
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:06,563
They still don't make them, but...

541
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:09,371
Is that a baby?

542
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:14,803
Let me know when you're
ready for the real thing.

543
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:19,201
Soon.

544
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:27,179
I...

545
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:29,139
I got to check on her. I'm sorry.

546
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:30,499
Do you want me to stay,
keep you company?

547
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,419
No, thanks.

548
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:34,819
I don't think she'd want
you to see her like this.

549
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:36,881
Careful.

550
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,819
But you... you go to the play

551
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:42,085
Not if you aren't.

552
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:51,179
I'll call you later, okay.

553
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:53,411
I'm sorry.

554
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:28,819
Come on, Mom.

555
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:31,722
You miss anymore classes you're
going to be worse than me.

556
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:34,600
Mom...

557
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:38,379
Mom.

558
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:40,019
Oh fuck!

559
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:41,099
Fuck.

560
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:43,365
Mom!

561
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:48,521
Mom?

562
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:52,539
I... I need an ambulance
at 1637 Sherwood Drive.

563
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:54,179
No!

564
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,499
My... my mom's not...

565
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,686
she's not breathing.

566
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:01,043
No, I can't. She's not breathing.

567
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:03,539
Oh, please.

568
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,139
Come on.

569
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:07,565
What do I do?

570
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:11,889
No, Mom, come on. Fuck! No. No.

571
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:14,171
No.

572
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:44,882
I said things to her
I shouldn't have.

573
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:55,605
I'll get some water.

574
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,379
Give me a minute.

575
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:11,819
I'll meet you at the car.

576
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:14,131
Okay.

577
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:23,726
Grandpa.

578
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:27,802
Is there any chance what
you were saying is true?

579
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:33,089
Walk me through the research.

580
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:45,659
By the way, my secretary
has access to the lab

581
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:47,739
but knows nothing of this and
I'd like to keep it that way.

582
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:48,739
Yeah, sure.

583
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:50,139
I suggest you follow suit.

584
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:52,246
Don't tell anyone.

585
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:55,779
Accounts for more than half
the increase last year

586
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:58,859
in the GNH of Ghana and the
source has been verified twice.

587
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:01,330
It's in the bibliography.

588
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:04,579
Well, that's excellent work.

589
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:06,367
Thank you.

590
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:13,619
How do you feel?

591
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:15,419
Relieved.

592
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:16,939
So are we celebrating or what?

593
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:18,019
Yeah, absolutely.

594
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:20,219
I just have to check on something
with gramps in the lab.

595
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:21,259
Everything okay?

596
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:22,379
Yeah. I'm just helping
him with something.

597
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:24,059
That's great. What?

598
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:25,379
Theoretical stuff.

599
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:26,899
Wormhole theories.

600
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:27,699
Science fiction?

601
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:28,619
Yeah, kind of.

602
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:31,379
Helps me relax, do something fun.

603
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:32,259
I'm glad.

604
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:36,050
So I'll call you later? Congrats.

605
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:44,619
Grandpa, if this is true,
why would he want to

606
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:47,761
meet with Einstein after
he invented the machine?

607
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,499
Well, read it.

608
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,099
Can't you just tell me?

609
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:52,699
I'm not entirely sure
what to tell you

610
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,499
but obviously it's important.

611
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:58,131
Okay. "The Lorentz Transformation"?

612
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:59,819
Yeah, yeah. Right here.

613
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:02,449
Your orders, gentlemen.

614
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:04,099
Coffee for the young man.

615
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:06,047
Thank you.

616
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:08,819
And Earl Grey for the Professor.

617
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:10,721
Thank you.

618
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:13,819
Uh, I'm done for the evening.

619
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:15,019
Need anything else?

620
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:17,763
Uh, no. No. Thank you.

621
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:20,206
Okay.

622
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:24,499
Gramps...?

623
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,526
Shut it.

624
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:31,259
Hey.

625
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:32,859
Hey. Where are you?

626
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:36,099
Uh, swamped. I don't
think I can make it.

627
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:36,699
Sorry.

628
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:38,859
Wow. Doesn't sound very relaxing.

629
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:41,019
Well, you know,
occupational hazard.

630
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:42,459
Well, don't work too hard.

631
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:44,600
Okay, I won't.

632
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,447
Bye.

633
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:51,499
So assume that in three
dimensions the X, Y and Z axis

634
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:54,339
are all parallel to their
respective counterparts.

635
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:59,059
And the relative velocity between the two
observers is V along the common x-axis.

636
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:02,219
So the two observers are using their own
Cartesian system to measure the intervals.

637
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:03,099
Exactly.

638
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:05,286
There's your negative energy.

639
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:06,819
This is so dangerous.

640
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:08,179
For a person to be inside this

641
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:10,379
while it travels
through a wormhole.

642
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:15,410
And even if it does work,
I mean, my father was killed.

643
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:23,779
Hey.

644
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:24,819
Hi.

645
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:26,139
What are you doing here?

646
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:27,819
What are you working on?

647
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:28,899
Experiment, actually.

648
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:31,539
It's kind of volatile.

649
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:32,819
Does it have something
to do with travelling

650
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:35,563
through a Wormhole into the past?

651
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:42,682
"Victim suffered a gunshot wound
and carried no identification.

652
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:46,299
Brands of clothing, unidentifiable.

653
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:49,979
The assailants left only his
pocket watch and his keys.

654
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:52,499
No witnesses, no suspects."

655
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:55,323
I... I think this is my father.

656
00:43:56,660 --> 00:44:00,259
I have to stop this
from happening in 1946.

657
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:02,219
I know it's hard to believe.

658
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:04,459
That's why I didn't tell you.

659
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:06,619
And... and the chances
of us succeeding

660
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:08,219
and doing something
like this are... are...

661
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:13,125
are so small, but we have to try.

662
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:18,371
But the payoff, everything
will be different.

663
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:21,164
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

664
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:23,379
You believe me, right?

665
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:26,219
I believe you believe it, but...

666
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:28,690
I know, it's crazy.

667
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:32,967
I felt the same way
as you, at first.

668
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:38,089
I have to get back to work.

669
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:45,379
Tonight, I'll make dinner.

670
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:46,859
You can ask me anything you want.

671
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:49,489
I'll... I'll explain
the science behind it.

672
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:52,846
Okay.

673
00:44:57,860 --> 00:44:59,899
Why didn't you tell mom
what you were doing?

674
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:01,539
Because I wouldn't
sure I'd succeed.

675
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:03,179
I didn't want to
give her false hope.

676
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:05,499
She needed to move on,
try to enjoy her life

677
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:07,299
in whatever form she could.

678
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:09,019
Are you sure that was
the right choice?

679
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:12,499
No, but I couldn't help but think
that if she did latch onto

680
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:15,259
the possibility of
bringing your father back,

681
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:16,699
couple that with her depression...

682
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:19,859
You were already afraid that she
was going to take her own life.

683
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:21,059
Exactly.

684
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:22,579
Why suffer through
the waiting period

685
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:24,970
if it'll all be corrected.

686
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:28,379
You're not thinking
of telling Grace?

687
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:29,779
No.

688
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:32,330
No, of course not.

689
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:40,407
Like old times.

690
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:49,019
If this works and you bring
your father back to 2000

691
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:52,259
what will happen to our lives
for the past twelve years?

692
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:54,844
My parents will be alive.

693
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:59,819
I'll... I'll be a happier
person, be more confident.

694
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:01,259
I won't be acting out of fear

695
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:04,083
that I'll lose the
people around me.

696
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:05,779
We... we're only changing one thing

697
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:07,939
that shouldn't have happened.

698
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:09,939
And so I don't...

699
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:12,459
I don't see your life
path changing that much.

700
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:16,339
You know, you'd have the same interests,
you'd go into the same field.

701
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:19,891
And we'd have no
memory of this life?

702
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:25,819
Sounds perfect...

703
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:28,019
if we're together.

704
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:29,179
Why wouldn't we be together?

705
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:31,499
Well, nothing's guaranteed, right?

706
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,459
I mean, I could get hit by a bus
or you could meet some other

707
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:37,139
girl going to the movies with
your dad and ask her out to prom?

708
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:38,659
I'm not going to ask anyone
else out to the prom.

709
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:40,539
No, I'm serious.

710
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:45,059
You gravitated towards me as a child
partly because you were missing a parent.

711
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:48,539
That first time you stayed at my place
was when your mom went to Princeton.

712
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:52,842
We spent day and night together,
and that won't happen now.

713
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:56,539
None of this will exist.

714
00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:59,363
And we won't even
know what this was.

715
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:02,539
What are the chances we repeat it?

716
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:05,807
We knew each other
well before 2000.

717
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:09,610
We were inseparable as children
before my father left.

718
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:12,250
We'll be together again.

719
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:14,859
I know it.

720
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:17,205
I'm sure of it.

721
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:27,979
I love you.

722
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:29,961
I love you too.

723
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:41,605
Wait. Wait. Wait. One second!

724
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:42,779
Erol.

725
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:43,899
Just one second.

726
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:46,739
Honey, it's just a
fucking chess board.

727
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:48,739
I just need some
things to motivate me.

728
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:50,299
Some things?

729
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:51,059
What?

730
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:52,179
It's everything.

731
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:53,339
It's just the chess board.

732
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:55,810
No, it's our life.

733
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:59,539
If you had the chance would you just
keep re-setting it 'til it was perfect?

734
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:00,939
This is coming from
an idealist who...

735
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:04,219
who spent the past two years studying
new economies for developing countries?

736
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:06,499
No, Erol, I'm a realist.

737
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:08,339
What's wrong with idealism?

738
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:09,779
What's wrong with wanting
a mother and a father

739
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:11,019
who aren't dead?

740
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:12,819
That's not fair. I didn't
choose any of this.

741
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:15,848
No, you didn't, but please...

742
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:19,202
please don't pretend
like you understand.

743
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:25,691
Grace...

744
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:29,299
We have a life here.

745
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:31,059
We talked about getting married,

746
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:35,099
said we were getting a new
place and start a family.

747
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:38,459
My father left unnaturally.
It had ripple effects...

748
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:40,739
- That we're dealing with!
- No, that I'm correcting.

749
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:42,459
Everyone that he might
have encountered,

750
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:46,370
- their lives have to revert back to...
- I'm pregnant!

751
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:50,163
How're you going to correct that?

752
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:24,489
How long?

753
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:27,805
Five weeks.

754
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:33,929
What do you want to do?

755
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:38,407
I don't know. I need time to think.

756
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:45,459
Stop working on this.

757
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:48,203
I don't know if I can.

758
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:53,082
Well, there's your answer then.

759
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:58,619
Is there any way to
make sure that Grace

760
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:00,419
and I will be together
in the new timeline?

761
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:03,099
You shouldn't be thinking about
messing with other elements.

762
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:05,699
The point here is
to correct things,

763
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:07,339
not create an ideal
world for yourself.

764
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:08,259
That is correct.

765
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:09,379
We're meant to be together.

766
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:11,699
So what, do you want to go back,
talk to yourself as a kid

767
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:13,619
and plant the idea
to woo her again?

768
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:14,259
I don't know.

769
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:16,339
The more attachments you make here,

770
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:19,527
the harder this will all be.

771
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:23,619
- How's the field stability?
- Terrible.

772
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:25,059
I've just been stuck for weeks.

773
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:28,327
Well, you're doing great.
Just keep at it, okay.

774
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:30,059
I got to go.

775
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:30,699
All right.

776
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:33,179
- You going to be okay?
- Yeah.

777
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:35,366
See you later.

778
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:46,819
All right, you're eight weeks in,
so it's still too early to tell.

779
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:48,699
But it looks good so far.

780
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:51,139
But I wouldn't tell your friends
for another month. Okay?

781
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:51,699
Okay.

782
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:53,726
All right.

783
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:10,659
No.

784
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:11,299
What?

785
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:13,059
It should be working.

786
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:15,539
The tangent vectors are correct,
I have D-S-squared defined,

787
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:18,259
but the accelerated end keeps
going off into who knows where?

788
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:20,810
Okay just... just calm down.

789
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:24,059
Uh... chalk?

790
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:26,405
Second drawer.

791
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:32,646
There's none left.

792
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:33,899
What difference does it make?

793
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:36,962
If I can't solve it,
how the hell can you?

794
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:41,019
Is he okay?

795
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:42,899
Yeah, he'll be fine.

796
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:45,245
Thanks, Mrs. Moore.

797
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:47,770
Are you all right?

798
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:52,099
Been a long time since
someone asked me that.

799
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:53,459
Well, I...

800
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:56,681
I've been meaning to ask you often.

801
00:52:57,180 --> 00:52:59,570
I'm fine, thanks.

802
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:05,219
I've noticed, Professor,
that outside of the lab

803
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:07,299
you're always alone.

804
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:11,841
If... if you ever need
to talk, I'm here.

805
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:15,379
I wish I could.

806
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:18,567
Maybe someday you'll
tell me why you can't?

807
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:21,881
I hope to be able to do that.

808
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:45,939
Hello?

809
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:47,619
Grace, it's Sal.

810
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:48,579
Hi.

811
00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:50,379
Do you have a minute?

812
00:53:50,380 --> 00:53:51,979
Not sure, really.

813
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:55,645
I just wanted to ask, how
has Erol been lately?

814
00:53:56,020 --> 00:53:58,099
I haven't really seen him.

815
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:01,259
I'm asleep when he gets home
and he's asleep when I leave.

816
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:03,739
I'm worried about him.

817
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:06,339
With all due respect, you put
this idea of "correcting"

818
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:08,259
everything into his head.

819
00:54:08,260 --> 00:54:11,447
Why would you care how he is?

820
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:19,099
Hi.

821
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:21,206
Hey.

822
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:23,299
How are you feeling?

823
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:25,326
Okay.

824
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:27,939
I got you chocolate milk and bacon.

825
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:30,285
Thanks.

826
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:34,762
I'll be working in the
basement if you need me.

827
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:01,849
Can we talk about this?

828
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:05,250
Say something.

829
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:07,579
What do you want to hear?

830
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:11,339
Every day I'm afraid this will all disappear
because part of me knows you'll succeed.

831
00:55:11,340 --> 00:55:16,699
But I want nothing more
than for you to fail.

832
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:19,259
Well, you might get your wish.

833
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:21,259
We've hit a snag.

834
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:22,499
Been stuck for weeks.

835
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:24,059
So you're stopping?

836
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:26,659
I can't stop until
I've tried everything.

837
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:28,846
You know that.

838
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:31,499
So what do you want?

839
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:33,499
What should I do?

840
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:34,539
Abort?

841
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:35,459
No!

842
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:36,819
Isn't that what you're doing?

843
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:38,419
No.

844
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:40,179
All of this will happen again.

845
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:41,739
It'll be better.

846
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:45,059
Do you ever think that maybe your
father was meant to die there?

847
00:55:45,060 --> 00:55:48,930
That was his natural
course and this is ours?

848
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:54,979
Don't you see, Erol, despite
everything I like this life.

849
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:56,019
I like who I am.

850
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:58,419
And I fell in love with
you as you were here.

851
00:55:58,420 --> 00:56:03,059
Grace, as I am, I'll
make a terrible father.

852
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:05,419
I don't want to pass
this down to our child.

853
00:56:05,420 --> 00:56:07,499
- I want a clean slate.
- Nobody has a clean slate!

854
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:11,085
Because nobody gets the
chance to have one.

855
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:15,579
I can't live like this,
knowing our lives could end

856
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:17,899
- at any second and we have no say.
- Most people don't.

857
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:20,723
And most people don't sleep
with the Grim Reaper.

858
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:24,859
Can you look me in
the eye and tell me,

859
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:27,419
with absolute assurance,

860
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:30,322
that if you go through with this,

861
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:33,601
we'd be able to recreate...

862
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:39,487
the soul of this baby?

863
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:49,099
Yeah.

864
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:51,099
I'll stop.

865
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:53,525
I'll stop.

866
00:56:57,020 --> 00:56:59,139
You're right.

867
00:56:59,140 --> 00:57:01,619
There's no guarantee.

868
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:03,819
I can't lose you.

869
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:05,939
I'll tell Sal I'm not
doing this anymore.

870
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:08,171
Okay?

871
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:19,459
The first time your mother
tried to commit suicide,

872
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:22,044
it was just before I moved here.

873
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:26,211
My God, you were only 15 years old.

874
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:28,059
The night before that happened,

875
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:31,819
I tried to convince her to
go out with another man.

876
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:39,126
I wanted her to move on, but she
flat-out rejected the idea.

877
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:41,731
We argued.

878
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:44,739
I told her she was being foolish
for holding onto the memory

879
00:57:44,740 --> 00:57:47,099
of your father for so long.

880
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:49,604
And the next day...

881
00:57:51,820 --> 00:57:55,451
She never stopped loving him.

882
00:57:56,820 --> 00:57:59,449
When your child's in distress...

883
00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:06,241
This was never supposed
to be her life.

884
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:11,562
It's my child I have
to protect now.

885
00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:16,764
I'm sorry.

886
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:25,699
As I said, it's four bedrooms.

887
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:27,219
I understand you're expecting.

888
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:29,019
We only need two.

889
00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:30,939
Ah, four's better.

890
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:31,619
Really?

891
00:58:31,620 --> 00:58:33,859
Yeah. You never know.

892
00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:35,659
Easy for you to say.

893
00:58:35,660 --> 00:58:37,766
And do.

894
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:46,899
So there's a large living area.

895
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:48,899
Perfect for a TV and
a sitting room.

896
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:50,219
Yeah.

897
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:51,659
TV right here.

898
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:53,539
I can have my recliner back here.

899
00:58:53,540 --> 00:58:56,499
- No. I don't want our kid watching TV.
- What?

900
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:59,179
- But I was going to...
- What? You don't like TV either.

901
00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:03,539
Yeah, but I could lie around on Sundays,
have my buddies over, drink some beers.

902
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:04,899
You don't have any buddies.

903
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:06,139
I'll make buddies.

904
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:08,379
And you'll hate every one of them.

905
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:10,691
Do you have a girlfriend?

906
00:59:25,580 --> 00:59:27,641
Play it out.

907
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:31,650
I'm serious, play it out.

908
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:07,979
We can always just suck it up
and do the banquet hall thing.

909
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:10,259
Why don't we do it
at the new place?

910
01:00:10,260 --> 01:00:11,499
There's room in the back yard.

911
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:14,299
We can just keep it to
close friends and family.

912
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:16,361
Small.

913
01:00:20,820 --> 01:00:22,846
Erol...

914
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:24,979
What?

915
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:27,211
What is it?

916
01:00:29,620 --> 01:00:31,219
How?

917
01:00:31,220 --> 01:00:33,219
It's hard to pinpoint.

918
01:00:33,220 --> 01:00:34,859
It was still early
in the pregnancy.

919
01:00:34,860 --> 01:00:37,019
May not have been a
fully viable embryo.

920
01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:39,259
Could it have been stress?

921
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:41,499
Could have been a factor, sure.
But sometimes it's...

922
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:43,459
it's just spontaneous.

923
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:45,539
I'm sorry.

924
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:48,090
I'll check in on her
again in an hour.

925
01:01:58,220 --> 01:01:59,819
Hi.

926
01:01:59,820 --> 01:02:03,059
I just heard. I'm so sorry.

927
01:02:03,060 --> 01:02:05,803
I figured you might come here.

928
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:08,844
Is Grace still at the hospital?

929
01:02:12,740 --> 01:02:15,085
This isn't it.

930
01:02:15,420 --> 01:02:18,482
My dad doesn't get
shot in an alley,

931
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:21,489
mom doesn't take those pills.

932
01:02:23,580 --> 01:02:28,121
My child does not spontaneously...

933
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:30,619
Every time I try to
commit to this life,

934
01:02:30,620 --> 01:02:33,045
something tells me
that I shouldn't.

935
01:02:38,140 --> 01:02:42,368
Sometimes I can see all the things that
were supposed to happen so clearly.

936
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:48,499
Grace comes to Cambridge
with me, we have a family.

937
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:50,059
It can all still happen.

938
01:02:50,060 --> 01:02:51,459
It has to.

939
01:02:51,460 --> 01:02:53,699
Well, it's up to you, kiddo.

940
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:55,019
You said we were close.

941
01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:59,481
We are, it's just this
one problem with the...

942
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:15,979
Earthquakes.

943
01:03:15,980 --> 01:03:17,939
What do you mean?

944
01:03:17,940 --> 01:03:21,819
We want to leave from here and
land on this spot in 1946.

945
01:03:21,820 --> 01:03:23,379
Now we know how the earth moves.

946
01:03:23,380 --> 01:03:25,459
We know where it will
be in its solar orbit.

947
01:03:25,460 --> 01:03:27,419
Our nutation calculations
were correct,

948
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:29,179
but in calculating the
rate of the earth's spin,

949
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:31,499
I completely forgot to account
for the seismic events

950
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:33,739
that alter the balance
of the earth's mass.

951
01:03:33,740 --> 01:03:35,099
And, therefore, the rate of spin.

952
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:37,419
Thirty-one events since 1946
that significantly altered

953
01:03:37,420 --> 01:03:38,939
the rate of rotation.

954
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:40,579
Last year's earthquake
in Japan, alone,

955
01:03:40,580 --> 01:03:43,099
shortened the earth's day by
1.8 millionths of a second.

956
01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:46,339
So we add that to the known
affects of ocean currents

957
01:03:46,340 --> 01:03:48,605
and atmospheric winds...

958
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:53,059
Exactly where and when we want.

959
01:03:53,060 --> 01:03:54,539
The computer was
calculating correctly,

960
01:03:54,540 --> 01:03:57,442
I just wasn't feeding
it the right variables.

961
01:04:02,020 --> 01:04:04,251
You've done it.

962
01:04:05,420 --> 01:04:09,483
Now, a couple more weeks of tests

963
01:04:09,540 --> 01:04:12,568
and I guess we'll never
know this happened.

964
01:04:13,620 --> 01:04:16,099
Your father would, in
theory, be the only one

965
01:04:16,100 --> 01:04:17,659
who'd remember any of this,

966
01:04:17,660 --> 01:04:19,579
since his life would
be uninterrupted

967
01:04:19,580 --> 01:04:23,245
from the moment we
intercepted him, onwards.

968
01:04:24,020 --> 01:04:26,539
So now what's the plan?

969
01:04:26,540 --> 01:04:28,646
Okay.

970
01:04:29,380 --> 01:04:33,099
I meet him as soon as he
gets of the plane in Newark.

971
01:04:33,100 --> 01:04:37,339
I think we should let as much of that
timeline occur before his disappearance.

972
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:39,819
- Gramps.
- What?

973
01:04:39,820 --> 01:04:42,219
I'm going to go, not you.

974
01:04:42,220 --> 01:04:45,659
No. If this doesn't work
you still have a life.

975
01:04:45,660 --> 01:04:47,019
It won't matter.

976
01:04:47,020 --> 01:04:49,419
This timeline will continue.

977
01:04:49,420 --> 01:04:51,779
We'll test it and make
sure everything is safe.

978
01:04:51,780 --> 01:04:53,739
But even if I don't succeed,
for whatever reason,

979
01:04:53,740 --> 01:04:55,539
you'll know because
nothing changes.

980
01:04:55,540 --> 01:04:57,619
And, at that point, you can do
whatever you think is necessary,

981
01:04:57,620 --> 01:04:59,579
but I have to try it my way.

982
01:04:59,580 --> 01:05:00,819
What is your way?

983
01:05:00,820 --> 01:05:02,659
Well, talking to him at the
airport isn't going to be enough.

984
01:05:02,660 --> 01:05:04,099
That depends on what we say.

985
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:07,139
He has to tell Marika.
That's the key.

986
01:05:07,140 --> 01:05:09,419
She has to be aware
of his intentions,

987
01:05:09,420 --> 01:05:11,019
then they can play
it out after that.

988
01:05:11,020 --> 01:05:13,739
No. We have to ensure that
he doesn't do it again.

989
01:05:13,740 --> 01:05:15,779
If we Ebenezer Scrooge
him here and now

990
01:05:15,780 --> 01:05:18,339
we could cease to exist
because he would have already

991
01:05:18,340 --> 01:05:19,499
avoided the mugging.

992
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:23,379
Our only asset is that we have
his memory in 2000 and 1946.

993
01:05:23,380 --> 01:05:26,059
That's the only thing that's going
to survive after the correction.

994
01:05:26,060 --> 01:05:27,779
In theory.

995
01:05:27,780 --> 01:05:29,939
We have to show him
the damage he's done

996
01:05:29,940 --> 01:05:32,808
without removing him
from his reality.

997
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:38,899
Just sign here.

998
01:05:38,900 --> 01:05:41,689
Your instructor will be
with you in a few minutes.

999
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:04,248
It's not about correcting anymore.

1000
01:06:05,180 --> 01:06:08,139
I'm going to make sure this
doesn't happen to us again,

1001
01:06:08,140 --> 01:06:10,280
whatever it takes.

1002
01:06:12,220 --> 01:06:16,219
Next time we meet we'll have
our whole wonderful lives

1003
01:06:16,220 --> 01:06:17,539
ahead of us.

1004
01:06:17,540 --> 01:06:19,805
I promise.

1005
01:06:41,420 --> 01:06:43,765
What is this?

1006
01:06:44,340 --> 01:06:47,619
Instructions for your
father to make sure

1007
01:06:47,620 --> 01:06:49,859
I visit Professor Gale's
chemistry department

1008
01:06:49,860 --> 01:06:52,739
on May 15, 2012.

1009
01:06:52,740 --> 01:06:54,880
Why?

1010
01:06:55,900 --> 01:06:59,326
Mrs. Moore will be
there, if you must know.

1011
01:07:03,780 --> 01:07:06,125
Ready?

1012
01:07:07,140 --> 01:07:09,619
So if nothing happens in three days

1013
01:07:09,620 --> 01:07:11,899
it's up to you to do it right.

1014
01:07:11,900 --> 01:07:14,131
Understood.

1015
01:07:15,060 --> 01:07:18,899
You know, if this works I'll
never be able to thank you.

1016
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:19,739
No, you won't.

1017
01:07:19,740 --> 01:07:23,579
And I won't know if you've been
incinerated for three days.

1018
01:07:23,580 --> 01:07:25,811
Well, the tests went fine.

1019
01:07:28,420 --> 01:07:30,970
I hope you'll visit
us more, Grandpa.

1020
01:07:32,420 --> 01:07:35,322
See you in another life, kiddo.

1021
01:07:51,420 --> 01:07:53,099
See you Friday.

1022
01:07:53,100 --> 01:07:55,286
Okay.

1023
01:07:57,340 --> 01:07:58,299
Say hi to dad.

1024
01:07:58,300 --> 01:08:00,326
Will do.

1025
01:08:06,660 --> 01:08:08,059
Hi.

1026
01:08:08,060 --> 01:08:08,939
Come on, honey.

1027
01:08:08,940 --> 01:08:10,099
We got to go. Got to go.

1028
01:08:10,100 --> 01:08:12,365
Got to go.

1029
01:08:20,820 --> 01:08:21,979
Hello?

1030
01:08:21,980 --> 01:08:23,139
Hey, Sal, how are you?

1031
01:08:23,140 --> 01:08:24,299
I'm great.

1032
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:25,139
Good flight?

1033
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:26,339
Yes, thanks.

1034
01:08:26,340 --> 01:08:29,179
I'm just getting out. I'll come
by after I check into the hotel.

1035
01:08:29,180 --> 01:08:30,939
Perfect. See you then.

1036
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:34,619
He's just growing up so fast. He's
got the same love of science as me.

1037
01:08:34,620 --> 01:08:38,419
But it's like Marika's
artistic flare

1038
01:08:38,420 --> 01:08:42,579
kind of balances him out somehow.

1039
01:08:42,580 --> 01:08:46,211
He's probably a better critical
thinker than I ever was.

1040
01:08:46,260 --> 01:08:49,242
Perhaps another student for me?

1041
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:51,459
So this is the place?

1042
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:53,619
Yes, indeed.

1043
01:08:53,620 --> 01:08:55,019
It's a dead space.

1044
01:08:55,020 --> 01:08:57,339
You'll be lucky if you see a
janitor down here once a week.

1045
01:08:57,340 --> 01:08:59,844
Some things never change.

1046
01:09:00,100 --> 01:09:03,651
Can I ask what this is all about?

1047
01:09:04,060 --> 01:09:05,539
I'm sorry.

1048
01:09:05,540 --> 01:09:08,179
After your dissertation I
promised never to question you

1049
01:09:08,180 --> 01:09:09,979
again, I take it back.

1050
01:09:09,980 --> 01:09:11,179
No, I just...

1051
01:09:11,180 --> 01:09:13,939
I guess I want somewhere
quiet to work, that's all.

1052
01:09:13,940 --> 01:09:17,085
- You okay for light?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

1053
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:19,459
Listen, I really appreciate this.

1054
01:09:19,460 --> 01:09:21,699
Thank you. Do you want to
meet up for lunch tomorrow?

1055
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:23,059
Yeah, sure.

1056
01:09:23,060 --> 01:09:25,179
Just let's touch
base in the morning.

1057
01:09:25,180 --> 01:09:27,419
- If you need anything else let me know.
- I will do.

1058
01:09:27,420 --> 01:09:30,400
- It's good to see you, Gabe.
- Good to see you too.

1059
01:09:31,460 --> 01:09:32,459
Good luck.

1060
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:34,600
Thanks.

1061
01:10:04,540 --> 01:10:05,339
Hello?

1062
01:10:05,340 --> 01:10:06,499
Hey, sleepy.

1063
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:07,579
Hm.

1064
01:10:07,580 --> 01:10:08,299
What time is it?

1065
01:10:08,300 --> 01:10:09,939
Six thirty.

1066
01:10:09,940 --> 01:10:11,339
How's the conference?

1067
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:12,579
I'm about to find out.

1068
01:10:12,580 --> 01:10:13,859
You need to get up.

1069
01:10:13,860 --> 01:10:15,419
Talk to you later, okay?

1070
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:15,979
Oh.

1071
01:10:15,980 --> 01:10:16,499
Okay.

1072
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:17,419
Bye, my darlin'.

1073
01:10:17,420 --> 01:10:19,321
Bye.

1074
01:14:31,780 --> 01:14:33,259
If you're looking
for the Professor,

1075
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:35,579
he's on his Saturday morning walk.

1076
01:14:35,580 --> 01:14:37,899
- Do you know when he'll be back?
- No.

1077
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:40,768
Why don't you people
go to his office?

1078
01:15:59,980 --> 01:16:02,086
What'll you have?

1079
01:16:02,300 --> 01:16:03,259
Johnny.

1080
01:16:03,260 --> 01:16:04,019
That's right.

1081
01:16:04,020 --> 01:16:05,899
Coffee?

1082
01:16:05,900 --> 01:16:07,099
Sure.

1083
01:16:07,100 --> 01:16:08,579
Make that two.

1084
01:16:08,580 --> 01:16:10,686
They're on me.

1085
01:16:11,260 --> 01:16:12,659
Oh no. That's not necessary.

1086
01:16:12,660 --> 01:16:14,499
No, please.

1087
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:16,811
Where are you from?

1088
01:16:17,580 --> 01:16:20,659
Well, London, originally.

1089
01:16:20,660 --> 01:16:22,971
Great city.

1090
01:16:23,900 --> 01:16:25,179
Welcome to Jersey.

1091
01:16:25,180 --> 01:16:27,730
Thanks Thanks, Johnny.

1092
01:16:30,420 --> 01:16:32,499
So what brings you here?

1093
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:33,619
Work.

1094
01:16:33,620 --> 01:16:36,010
What kind of work do you do?

1095
01:16:38,580 --> 01:16:40,019
I've had a very strange day.

1096
01:16:40,020 --> 01:16:41,179
I don't mean to be rude.

1097
01:16:41,180 --> 01:16:42,339
That's okay.

1098
01:16:42,340 --> 01:16:43,419
You new here?

1099
01:16:43,420 --> 01:16:44,379
Yeah.

1100
01:16:44,380 --> 01:16:46,139
A wild guess.

1101
01:16:46,140 --> 01:16:48,326
You're in research?

1102
01:16:50,220 --> 01:16:51,699
Takes one to know one.

1103
01:16:51,700 --> 01:16:54,329
Institute or university?

1104
01:16:55,620 --> 01:16:57,339
I can't really talk about it.

1105
01:16:57,340 --> 01:16:58,579
It's okay. I can't tell you

1106
01:16:58,580 --> 01:17:01,881
that I'm here on a theoretical
physics scholarship.

1107
01:17:04,380 --> 01:17:05,699
You're very young.

1108
01:17:05,700 --> 01:17:08,090
What are you working on?

1109
01:17:08,180 --> 01:17:10,819
I'm doing a paper on a
phenomenon called wormholes.

1110
01:17:10,820 --> 01:17:12,179
It's purely theoretical.

1111
01:17:12,180 --> 01:17:14,099
My mentor, Dr. Weyl's
the real expert.

1112
01:17:14,100 --> 01:17:16,729
I'm just learning about it.

1113
01:17:18,660 --> 01:17:21,005
My name's Erol.

1114
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:22,499
My son's name's Erol.

1115
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:23,979
Really?

1116
01:17:23,980 --> 01:17:26,120
Where's he?

1117
01:17:26,340 --> 01:17:27,419
At home.

1118
01:17:27,420 --> 01:17:29,560
How long you here for?

1119
01:17:30,700 --> 01:17:32,179
Not long.

1120
01:17:32,180 --> 01:17:33,179
Well, that's good.

1121
01:17:33,180 --> 01:17:34,699
One thing I found in travelling is

1122
01:17:34,700 --> 01:17:37,682
that you can't stay away
from home too long.

1123
01:17:37,900 --> 01:17:39,379
Not good for family life.

1124
01:17:39,380 --> 01:17:43,619
If I may ask, what angle are you
researching on wormhole theory?

1125
01:17:43,620 --> 01:17:46,727
What the implications of
a stable one would be.

1126
01:17:47,340 --> 01:17:49,819
Really? What have you found so far?

1127
01:17:49,820 --> 01:17:51,899
Do you love them?

1128
01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:52,939
What?

1129
01:17:52,940 --> 01:17:55,490
Your family. Do you love them?

1130
01:17:56,100 --> 01:17:57,779
Yeah, I love my work and my family.

1131
01:17:57,780 --> 01:18:00,011
That must be nice.

1132
01:18:00,100 --> 01:18:02,379
In my experience, one or
the other has to give.

1133
01:18:02,380 --> 01:18:04,379
Well, it's just a matter of
finding the right balance.

1134
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:07,442
Do you mind if I ask you how
you found that balance?

1135
01:18:07,700 --> 01:18:09,219
I don't know.

1136
01:18:09,220 --> 01:18:13,409
Well, you're doing better than
I am. I got no wife, no kids.

1137
01:18:13,900 --> 01:18:15,739
Both my parents are dead.

1138
01:18:15,740 --> 01:18:16,539
I'm...

1139
01:18:16,540 --> 01:18:18,579
I'm sorry.

1140
01:18:18,580 --> 01:18:20,845
Yeah, you should be.

1141
01:18:21,300 --> 01:18:23,219
Oh, well, good luck
with your paper.

1142
01:18:23,220 --> 01:18:25,459
Actually, my father's not dead yet.

1143
01:18:25,460 --> 01:18:27,779
He left me when I was nine.

1144
01:18:27,780 --> 01:18:30,859
My mom and I dropped him
off at the airport.

1145
01:18:30,860 --> 01:18:32,939
He was going on a business
trip to Princeton

1146
01:18:32,940 --> 01:18:34,339
and he was supposed to
come back in a few days,

1147
01:18:34,340 --> 01:18:36,539
but he never did.

1148
01:18:36,540 --> 01:18:38,930
We waited a long time.

1149
01:18:38,980 --> 01:18:41,259
I mean, my mom did.

1150
01:18:41,260 --> 01:18:44,527
It was so long ago I don't
really remember him.

1151
01:18:45,180 --> 01:18:47,099
My mom went back to school
and became a professor.

1152
01:18:47,100 --> 01:18:49,099
And she was inspired in her work.

1153
01:18:49,100 --> 01:18:51,099
But she never got
over the confusion

1154
01:18:51,100 --> 01:18:53,889
of not knowing where
my father went.

1155
01:18:54,180 --> 01:18:57,699
I think she thought he ran
off with another woman.

1156
01:18:57,700 --> 01:19:01,809
She was devastated and
she took her own life.

1157
01:19:03,180 --> 01:19:06,259
Then my grandfather
came to me and he said

1158
01:19:06,260 --> 01:19:10,419
that we could find my father
if we worked together.

1159
01:19:10,420 --> 01:19:15,370
It would take time, maybe years
to figure out what he had done.

1160
01:19:15,740 --> 01:19:18,130
But we did it.

1161
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:21,209
I haven't seen him in 12 years.

1162
01:19:21,460 --> 01:19:23,566
Erol?

1163
01:19:24,940 --> 01:19:27,330
Oh my God.

1164
01:19:28,380 --> 01:19:30,964
So tell me about Einstein.

1165
01:19:31,060 --> 01:19:33,139
That's why you're here, isn't it?

1166
01:19:33,140 --> 01:19:35,019
Huh? Yeah.

1167
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:36,459
Why?

1168
01:19:36,460 --> 01:19:40,404
What... what could he possibly tell
you that you don't already know?

1169
01:19:42,540 --> 01:19:44,885
First tell me...

1170
01:19:46,140 --> 01:19:48,724
what happens to me?

1171
01:19:51,740 --> 01:19:53,979
Tonight you're mugged.

1172
01:19:53,980 --> 01:19:56,120
They kill you.

1173
01:19:57,660 --> 01:19:59,846
That's it.

1174
01:20:03,780 --> 01:20:07,649
All this work and some guys take
you for the money in your pocket.

1175
01:20:09,060 --> 01:20:09,979
What is this?

1176
01:20:09,980 --> 01:20:11,219
It's you.

1177
01:20:11,220 --> 01:20:14,691
It's your suit, it's
your description.

1178
01:20:16,180 --> 01:20:19,287
They left your pocket watch.
I don't know why.

1179
01:20:19,860 --> 01:20:22,808
You're wearing your keys
in your left pocket?

1180
01:20:28,100 --> 01:20:30,126
Yeah.

1181
01:20:37,140 --> 01:20:39,724
The basement wall?

1182
01:20:40,780 --> 01:20:44,968
This is everything you've
missed for 12 years.

1183
01:20:54,380 --> 01:20:57,123
You really were a good father.

1184
01:20:57,140 --> 01:20:59,405
I was a happy kid.

1185
01:21:05,900 --> 01:21:08,370
How did she die?

1186
01:21:10,140 --> 01:21:12,246
Pills.

1187
01:21:14,140 --> 01:21:16,539
It was her third try.

1188
01:21:16,540 --> 01:21:17,899
She couldn't bear not knowing

1189
01:21:17,900 --> 01:21:20,962
why the love of her life vanished.

1190
01:21:22,940 --> 01:21:23,939
And you...?

1191
01:21:23,940 --> 01:21:26,099
I lost everything.

1192
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:28,899
And I rebuilt your dream.

1193
01:21:28,900 --> 01:21:30,899
It's all here.

1194
01:21:30,900 --> 01:21:34,644
All because you wouldn't tell
her what you were doing.

1195
01:21:34,780 --> 01:21:37,499
So you tell me, why?

1196
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:39,579
I... I tried. I tried
so many times.

1197
01:21:39,580 --> 01:21:41,979
You never said the words,
"I'm building a..."

1198
01:21:41,980 --> 01:21:43,419
She didn't want to hear it.

1199
01:21:43,420 --> 01:21:43,939
She...

1200
01:21:43,940 --> 01:21:45,899
anything that would
change our life, she...

1201
01:21:45,900 --> 01:21:48,779
she... she wouldn't have it.

1202
01:21:48,780 --> 01:21:50,739
She's happy, you know.

1203
01:21:50,740 --> 01:21:53,099
I decided I... I can travel.

1204
01:21:53,100 --> 01:21:54,259
I can go, I can come back.

1205
01:21:54,260 --> 01:21:55,339
She'll never know.

1206
01:21:55,340 --> 01:21:57,179
Try and speak in the past tense.

1207
01:21:57,180 --> 01:21:59,684
It was a long time ago.

1208
01:22:01,460 --> 01:22:04,089
